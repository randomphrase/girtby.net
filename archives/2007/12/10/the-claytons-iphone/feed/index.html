		<description>&lt;p&gt;Rockin&#039; review!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking at these the other day and I had two questions that the sales staff didn&#039;t answer.  You haven&#039;t developed sufficiently advanced telepathy to anticipate in your review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&#039;s the battery life &lt;em&gt;really like&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much data transfer does the GPS function take up?  If you did an 13-ish hour drive, would you be at the upper limit of one of them thar cheap-ass HSDPA data deals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[feel free to delete this - one heading above has a typo: &quot;HDSPA&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris. Telepathy aside, I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; actually meant to talk about battery life before hitting the publish button, but for whatever reason, didn&#039;t. Possibly red wine was involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I read somewhere that the GPS function uses the battery very aggressively. In reality this isn&#039;t much of a problem because in the car you&#039;ll generally have it hooked up to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main limitation I&#039;ve found is heavy data usage. Right now I&#039;m about to depart for an overnight trip and I anticipate that after the two days and one night of reasonably sustained data usage the battery will be on its last legs when I return tomorrow night. Any more than a night and I&#039;ll have to bring a charger. If the bloody thing charged through a USB port it wouldn&#039;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a reasonably generous data plan (500MB/month) so I don&#039;t watch the bits and bytes too closely. However daily data usage is itemised on my bill and have noticed very light usage on the days that I&#039;m not downloading the internet. I would be surprised if the AGPS used more than a few K of data - it doesn&#039;t even seem to bring up the &quot;3.5G&quot; symbol to say that an HSDPA connection has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the Google Maps for Mobile client which is awesome but (as you can probably imagine) uses up data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, feel free to get cheap-ass HSDPA if you just want the GPS function using the standard software.&lt;/p&gt;
