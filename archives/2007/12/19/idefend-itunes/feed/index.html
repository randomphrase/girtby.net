		<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t hate iTunes, I accept it in all of its gradual restyling away from brushed metal glory.  As a serial iPod user, I too am suffering a little from Stockholm syndrome, but that&#039;s not to say I don&#039;t have gripes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptic UI controls in odd places (What does the tick do again? There&#039;s no tooltip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search gadget up the top, browse down the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribe to podcast under the &quot;Advanced&quot; menu (Next to Open stream... !?) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#039;s a nice tree-like thing on the left, but I can&#039;t use it for the one thing trees might be good for... organizing my play lists into a place where they&#039;re convenient to get to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insane CPU usage during pod cast downloads (2 pod casts = 30% of CPU on a dual core 2GHz) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given N iTunes libraries.  How do I sync them, or join them in such a way as to not lose my playlists and podcast subs? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;52MB installer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can only back up to DVD and CD, not a network or file system location?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iTunes help is full of long-broken URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Agree Chris. Actually it struck me when reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2007/12/20/itunes-and-i/&quot;&gt;Julian&#039;s response&lt;/a&gt; that because I have been using iTunes for so long I was a bit blind to some of its flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupid &quot;minibrowser&quot; for instance; when I was first confronted with this I sighed deeply, then found the command to disable it, and promptly dismissed it from sight and memory. Same with the silly iTunes store links that look like play buttons - I re-mapped them to link to artists/songs in the library and learned to overlook the confusing similarity with the play button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve probably got Stockholm syndrome too. Having said that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cryptic UI controls in odd places (What does the tick do again? There’s no tooltip!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covered above mostly. The checkbox is used for fine-grained control over what tracks to load into an iPod. Completely useless when your iPod is larger than your library. Lack of tooltip is bad though I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Search gadget up the top, browse down the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Err, what? It&#039;s exactly the same layout as Firefox and IE. Incidentally I think the incremental search is one of the best features of iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Subscribe to podcast under the “Advanced” menu (Next to Open stream… !?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agree - I think this is another form of subtle iTunes store promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish this wasn&#039;t the case but in coaching my mum through the process of subscribing to podcasts, I find it easier to tell her to go through the iTunes store. The copy/paste feed URL dance is more difficult to describe than a simple search. Not sure whether moving the &quot;subscribe to podcast&quot; item out of the Advanced menu would help significantly here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a nice tree-like thing on the left, but I can’t use it for the one thing trees might be good for… organizing my play lists into a place where they’re convenient to get to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Err, sorry? You can certainly have hierarchical-ordered playlists. (File &gt; New Folder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that the sources list is also straight outta Macdom and differs from a conventional Windows tree view in that there&#039;s no root for the tree. But as we have discussed many times, the &quot;fake root node&quot; is an endemic problem with Windows tree views. Lack of a root node is a feature not a bug IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I suppose another difference is that iTunes uses triangles instead of plus signs to control the expansion of the tree. However I&#039;ve been told that Vista does something similar now (never used Vista myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Insane CPU usage during pod cast downloads (2 pod casts = 30% of CPU on a dual core 2GHz)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes this is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given N iTunes libraries. How do I sync them, or join them in such a way as to not lose my playlists and podcast subs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync, dunno. But you can join them by doing an export/import (file menu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;52MB installer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this includes QuickTime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can only back up to DVD and CD, not a network or file system location?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure that once you&#039;ve backed up your playlists and meta-data (eg by export or just copying the relevant iTunes Library files) all you need to do to back up the tracks is copy them directly out of their original location. This is what I do anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;iTunes help is full of long-broken URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never noticed this.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Trees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to move my stuff up the top and the store, library, ringtones down the bottom.  I guess this is a minor niggle, but having to scroll all the time to get to what I want is annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync is essential for anyone with computers/laptops and should really be a first class citizen in the UI.  The opportunity to screw up your library and at best spend hours re-curating it is very very worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;52MB installer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I already have QuickTime!  And the Apple updater keeps it up to date for me too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup to DVD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who only has a couple of DVDs worth of media anymore?  Making your library safe should be a primary concern of iTunes, and the lack of a UI-obvious method sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;What Problem Are You Trying To Solve?&quot;&gt;WPAYTTS?&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume your problem is pretty similar to mine: multiple computers, and the desire to have the same music library available at each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current solution is to simply carry my library on iPod. I plug the iPod into whatever computer I&#039;m working with and access the music directly. I realise this isn&#039;t exactly ideal for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution also has some problems of its own. In fact my vote for the single most annoying limitation of iTunes would go to the following: In order to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; the files on a connected iPod, I need to &lt;em&gt;change the sync settings&lt;/em&gt;, specifically check the &quot;Manually manage music and videos&quot; checkbox. This also pops up a succession of warning dialogs (each and every time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after doing this, there are other problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking this checkbox resets the play count of songs you have listened to since the last sync. In other words if you listen to a podcast on the way to work, when you get to work and click the &quot;Manually manage&quot; checkbox, that podcast will be marked as not-listened-to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the browsing features are mysteriously unavailable. Coverflow for instance. And party shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately however any changes you make to the song rating &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; synchronised when you plug back into the &quot;master&quot; iTunes library (consistent with making the ratings change on the iPod itself). This is handy for those of us who are &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2005/11/03/itunes-library-preening/&quot;&gt;compulsively preening&lt;/a&gt; our music libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I for one would rather a &quot;play only&quot; mode for a connected iPod rather than a method of syncing between iTunes Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s my US$0.02:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you know where I&#039;m coming from:  I use iTunes on my PC primarily as podcast-catcher.  It does the job well enough that I haven&#039;t been motivated to look for another program for this purpose.  I like how well iTunes is integrated with sites that offer podcast feeds, and how the Apple Store offers to host so many free podcasts.  I also use iTunes for ripping and burning music CDs, listening to streamed music, and managing downloaded (MP3) song files.  I don&#039;t have an iPod, so except for a couple of occasions when I made party mixes for my sister, on her iPod and her Mac, this isn&#039;t an area of interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the UI quirks are either things I was already used to from my Mac experience, or were not hard to get used to.  As you point out, Alastair, the UI for a lot of Windows-specific programs is far worse.  I&#039;ll be the 10 millionth person to agree that Windows Media Player is a horror, and I never use it.  The ones that really get me are the programs that come with some bizarre skin, right out of the box.  It makes me absolutely crazy when anti-malware programs install, by default, with a skin that looks like a game controller or media player, forcing me to hunt through preferences to figure out how to disable the skin, just to launch a scan or configure the schedule settings.  Even if iTunes is quirky, at least it&#039;s not completely non-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main PC is an aging Win2K box with only 256 MB of RAM.  iTunes takes a little longer than I&#039;d like to launch (about 10 seconds) and if I&#039;m running several other apps at the same time, switching between them can mean a bit of a delay, presumably, while things are swapped in and out of virtual memory.  I&#039;d have to give iTunes a win on this one, though, since I&#039;m being borderline unreasonable with the set-up I&#039;m asking it to run on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a few minor complaints, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;iTunes requires me to be logged in as Administrator to install it or to upgrade it.  This is stupid.  Win2K has the group called &quot;Power Users,&quot; or whatever the exact name is, and this group has permission to install applications.  My regular account is part of this group.  Admittedly, iTunes is not the only program broken in this regard, but Apple still deserves criticism for this.  Mozilla doesn&#039;t require me to be logged in as Administrator to install or update Firefox and Thunderbird, for example, and neither do many other third-party apps.  I think there is a case to be made for requiring the Administrator to install system-critical software, like drivers and anti-malware software, but programs that are just for fun shouldn&#039;t be held to this same standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quicktime is included, and there is no way around it.  Boo, hiss.  I have no need for Quicktime -- I don&#039;t use the visualization thing when I&#039;m running iTunes.  Unless I&#039;m managing songs or podcast feeds, the program spends its life minimized.  It should be easy enough to set iTunes up so that if Quicktime &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; required, it would inform you of that at the appropriate time.  The tightly bound integration makes me think of Quicktime as shovelware, and breaks the Unix-motivated ideal of apps that play well together without interdependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update process is annoying.  I don&#039;t understand why the whole program (plus Quicktime) has to be downloaded every time a security patch is issued.  Granted, my connection is now speedy enough that this has become only a minor annoyance, but requiring a 50 MB download to fix a hole means lots of people put off keeping their software up to date.  Why is Mozilla capable of issuing patches that are smaller than 1 MB, and Apple is not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update process is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; annoying.  After downloading and installing a security patch, the shortcuts in the Quick Launch bar and my custom-built folder of frequently used apps are both broken, even though the program appears to live in the same place.  I have to recreate two shortcuts every time I patch the program.  No other application that I&#039;ve ever used has this flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One UI gripe, to close:  There should be a way to create more structure in the podcasts section.  Since I have a fair amount of feeds, I&#039;d like to be able to create folders.  If I&#039;m missing something here, please let me know.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<li><p>iTunes requires me to be logged in as Administrator to install it or to upgrade it.  This is stupid.  Win2K has the group called &#8220;Power Users,&#8221; or whatever the exact name is, and this group has permission to install applications.  My regular account is part of this group.  Admittedly, iTunes is not the only program broken in this regard, but Apple still deserves criticism for this.  Mozilla doesn&#8217;t require me to be logged in as Administrator to install or update Firefox and Thunderbird, for example, and neither do many other third-party apps.  I think there is a case to be made for requiring the Administrator to install system-critical software, like drivers and anti-malware software, but programs that are just for fun shouldn&#8217;t be held to this same standard.</p></li>
<li><p>Quicktime is included, and there is no way around it.  Boo, hiss.  I have no need for Quicktime &#8212; I don&#8217;t use the visualization thing when I&#8217;m running iTunes.  Unless I&#8217;m managing songs or podcast feeds, the program spends its life minimized.  It should be easy enough to set iTunes up so that if Quicktime <em>is</em> required, it would inform you of that at the appropriate time.  The tightly bound integration makes me think of Quicktime as shovelware, and breaks the Unix-motivated ideal of apps that play well together without interdependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>The update process is annoying.  I don&#8217;t understand why the whole program (plus Quicktime) has to be downloaded every time a security patch is issued.  Granted, my connection is now speedy enough that this has become only a minor annoyance, but requiring a 50 MB download to fix a hole means lots of people put off keeping their software up to date.  Why is Mozilla capable of issuing patches that are smaller than 1 MB, and Apple is not?</p></li>
<li><p>The update process is <em>really</em> annoying.  After downloading and installing a security patch, the shortcuts in the Quick Launch bar and my custom-built folder of frequently used apps are both broken, even though the program appears to live in the same place.  I have to recreate two shortcuts every time I patch the program.  No other application that I&#8217;ve ever used has this flaw.</p></li>
<li><p>One UI gripe, to close:  There should be a way to create more structure in the podcasts section.  Since I have a fair amount of feeds, I&#8217;d like to be able to create folders.  If I&#8217;m missing something here, please let me know.  Thanks.</p></li>
