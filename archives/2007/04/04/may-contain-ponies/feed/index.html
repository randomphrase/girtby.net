		<description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&#039;t the problem that there are some sites, (ones with ponies?), that will lie and cheat to get their content in front of impressionable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my own kids used to be drawn like &quot;moths to the flame&quot; of sites offering animated cursors and kids games only to end up having their computer infected with trogens that popped up objectionable ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, assuming these publishers won&#039;t play ball with self classification, it means we would need third party classification. That&#039;s always going to be controversial. I like looking at good photography, I don&#039;t want some conservative telling me it&#039;s porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support the .xxx domain. A lot of sites will go there, you know what you&#039;re going to get there, but it won&#039;t stop the worst offenders getting through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So, assuming these publishers won’t play ball with self classification, it means we would need third party classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marxy, that&#039;s what I was trying to address in the last paragraph. Basically I&#039;m saying that in the general case you can&#039;t trust the publishers, and you can&#039;t trust third parties. The only way to get a realistic picture of the nature of the content is to aggregate. Employ the wisdom of the crowds, just like we do with search engines. That&#039;s the only way I can see for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; metadata to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this conflicts with what you said previously. The .xxx domain &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; self classification.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There is something to be said for the &quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot; hypothesis, but I think this technique breaks down whenever the topic in question is purely a matter of taste; e.g., politics, religion, and sex.  Providing a method for the teeming masses to rate a site, say, 1-10 on its adult content level, would likely result in voting spam between zealots of the James Dobson ilk and ultra-libertarians.  Think of the edit wars on certain Wikipedia pages, for example.  In the case of rating a site for adult content, I would also expect less scrupulous webmasters to develop bots that would skew the vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s another example:  the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siteadvisor.com/&quot;&gt;McAfee SiteAdvisor&lt;/a&gt; offers an add-on for browsers that turns green, yellow, or red, based on its safety evaluation of the current site for things like spyware and spam.  Part of its rating system comes from its own automated web crawling, and part comes from user input.  SiteAdvisor tends to produce a lot of false positives -- a yellow or red rating -- that from my observations seem to stem from negative votes cast by as few as two other users.  In many cases, these users seem to have been motivated by animus toward the site&#039;s point of view or personal dislike of the site&#039;s owner -- they&#039;ll report that a site&#039;s download offerings contain spyware when they don&#039;t, or when a site doesn&#039;t even offer any downloads.  The obvious consequence is that one tends to ignore the SiteAdvisor warnings after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that your idea is completely without merit.  It couldn&#039;t hurt to try, I suppose, and any additional tool may be of use to some people.  I just have serious doubts as to how well it could work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I think that if an aggregate content rating were to achieve the same level of accuracy as Wikipedia does with its subject matter, it would be doing pretty well, edit-wars or no edit-wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key ingredient in getting a decision from a wise crowd to ensure that each of the members is acting independently. This clearly isn&#039;t the case with Wikipedia, where the most recent edit &quot;wins&quot;, but could be the case for an aggregated rating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also not everyone has to be using the same classification scheme. One group of people could be using FOSI and another group could be rating sites for their pony content, and we would only need to aggregate like with like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the whole premise of the wisdom of crowds is to allow errors to be cancelled out. In the ratings system this means extreme opinions will be nullified by equal and opposite extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dammit, it has to work! Because I don&#039;t like the alternative of single-source ratings!&lt;/p&gt;
