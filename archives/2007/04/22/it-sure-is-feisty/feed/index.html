		<description>&lt;p&gt;My condolences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#039;re quite right to call out Ubuntu for missing this hardware problem -- your hardware doesn&#039;t sound overly exotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I didn&#039;t read carefully enough, but would you please be more explicit about what you did that &quot;eventually solved [your] problem&quot;?  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;The great thing is that you could see &quot;agpgart: No usable aperture found.&quot; etc during the boot sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a system from a PC shop a while back and noticed that the hardware guy booted it up with a linux liveCD before handing it over, when I commented on this he explained that booting linux is an excellent test and diagnostic of the hardware, better than just the bios and more helpful by far than Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Ubuntu 7.04 was completely smooth, but then I have very generic intel hardware. Ubuntu has surged ahead of Fedora on the desktop, but I still use FC6 as a server mostly due to familliarity.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Reworded slightly. The solution was adding &lt;code&gt;iommu=noaperture&lt;/code&gt; to the kernel boot line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&#039;d like to call Ubuntu on this, but I&#039;m conscious that the nVidia drivers are &quot;restricted&quot; and hence explicitly &lt;em&gt;excluded&lt;/em&gt; from the standard Ubuntu base. I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; that the testing responsibility falls on nVidia&#039;s shoulders, but I can&#039;t imagine that the BIOS/motherboard vendor (Award/Gigabyte) is entirely in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible lesson from all this is that there is a distinct need for systems integrators - vendors who can provide combined hardware and software that has had some testing and hence some guarantee against problems like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it can be open-sourced? That is, a collaborative environment for authoring a test suite, and a catalogue of knowledge on how to source and assemble appropriate hardware (with specific makes and models) and software to pass the test suite. The result would be a set of &quot;known good&quot; hardware, not just as components, but as entire systems including components and configuration. Maybe there is something like this out there already?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gigabyte K8NS-939, Athlon 64 X2 system and saw the same &quot;No usable aperture found.&quot; message. There was a special hidden setting in the Bios setup where I had to hit &quot;Ctrl-F1&quot; to activate the Advanced Chipset Menu. After that, I was able to change the AGP aperture in the Bios and the dmesg entries then became a message stating that the AGP Aperture had been set to 128mb, which is what I chose in the Bios. No changes to kernel boot parameters or modules required. Your motherboard manufacturer may have also hidden the AGP aperture setting or even called it something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI, the iommu=noaperture did help because I tried it before finding the Bios setting, but it forced the aperture to be 32mb, which is small for my 128mb NVidia GeForce 6800XT card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the quick &quot;not really a benchmark but it does give a number&quot; &quot;glxgears -printfps&quot; test, I went from 6200 fps to 9100 fps using either the bios change or iommu=noaperture. I may reinstall Quake4 and see if that performance is improved.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;FYI The nVidia AGP aperture size causes problems for MS Windows too - it occurs on my Shuttle XPC running Windows 2000 if the BIOS AGP settings are not spot on. Unlike Feisty (which did the same thing as you experienced on my Tecra laptop), Windows does boot and use the video hardware but will crash every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sir!!  After much research, your solution worked great.  Eliminated the slow jerky screens, poor scrolling, and a host of other related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora 8
AMD 64
Biostar TForce 6100-939 (mother board)
Acer 22&quot; AL2216W (flat monitor)
MSI NX8500GT (nVidia video card)&lt;/p&gt;
