		<description>&lt;p&gt;The link &quot;appearance at a Lynchburg, VA university,&quot; does not work.  Specifically, it seems as if your blogging platform has converted the two dashes (- -) in the URL into an em dash (&em;), and URL-encoded the result.  Not sure if there&#039;s anything you can do about that, except report a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@Andrew: Nice catch, thanks. Mephisto and Markdown+Smartypants have not been playing nice. I&#039;ve worked around it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@marxy: Thanks for the link, will listen.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;An excellent find. When you find someone who can take your thoughts, crystallises and refines them, fact-checks them (I would &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; that he&#039;d do this, although I can&#039;t be actually sure), and puts them in a thesis that you can easily hand off to someone you can&#039;t be bothered having an arguement with, that makes things a lot more convenient to people who&#039;d rather not be bothered with the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, despite that you&#039;ve now got your thoughts in order (almost manifesto-like) as an atheist, how exactly does an atheist propose to convince someone whose main issue is belief itself. Conversations like this do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go down well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice: well, we can agree to disagree. After all, it&#039;s all relative, you believe what you believe and I believe what I believe and we can&#039;t change each other&#039;s minds.
Me: Not quite. You see, &lt;em&gt;you&#039;re&lt;/em&gt; full of shit.
Alice: I remain unconvinced. Also, the inverted pentagram on your t-shirt is not helping.
Me: Crap.&lt;/p&gt;
