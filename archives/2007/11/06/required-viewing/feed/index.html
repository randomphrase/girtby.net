		<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional languages, or hybrid languages with clearly demarked separation of conventional and functional code (NOT what Python does), may provide some of the answers, because functional code deals with data that&#039;s assumed immutable, so &quot;state&quot; (which is the chief fly in the ointment when it comes to concurrency) goes away to a large extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scala is a really interesting hybrid language, although I regret that it only targets Java bytecode or MSIL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A language like Haskell (not that I&#039;d suggest it comes anywhere near being the sort of silver bullet I&#039;m talking about) usefully provides the expressiveness needed to model concurrent programming solutions that we will probably turn to in the future, like transactional memory, in a formally verifiable way.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the recommendation.  I enjoyed the talk quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being too much of a Pollyanna, I do think Sutter exaggerates the scope of the problem a little.  I don&#039;t dispute any of his claims about pipeline and latency issues, but for the vast majority of regular computer use, this isn&#039;t a noticeable problem.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s real for video processing and other computationally intensive applications, but the real problem with perceived slowness these days is (1) how long it takes applications to load in the first place (Java, for example, has gotten unbelievable) and of course, (2) network bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I recognize that Sutter was talking to a select audience, one that is on the cutting edge of programming, and that it always matters to this sort that every problem be addressed.  I&#039;m glad for such people.&lt;/p&gt;
