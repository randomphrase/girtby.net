		<description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like you&#039;ve done a fine job running the CAT-5 cable through your wall there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally agree about &quot;wall warts&quot;, they are a nuisance for all of us. Surely consumer electronics companies could set a simple standard for DC power supplies, most things run on 5V or 12V and if there was a standard input plug for these two voltages we could do sensible things like have one power supply to power multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best power supplies are those that can either plug directly in to a wall socket (via a suitable local mains pin assembly) or accept a mains cord.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks Marxy, although I should point out that credit for the work itself should go to my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glenco.com.au/&quot;&gt;glenco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Apple&#039;s DC power supplies are pretty much ideal. They&#039;re small, light, and &lt;em&gt;thin&lt;/em&gt;. They are also modular, meaning that you can easily swap out one country&#039;s plug configuration for another. If all else fails you can fall back to a &quot;figure-8&quot; power cord, which is reasonably standard. Not to forget details like the fold-out hooks for winding, and the mag-safe connector.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I also hired an electrician to do a long run of co-ax from my computer room, up between double brick, through the roof and out to the opposite end of the house. It was a terrible job, largely due to the high temperature and dust in the roof space. Poor bloke was a sweaty mess by the end. Worth every penny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple have done a good job on their recent supplies but I did have the magnetic socket in the laptop pick up some little pieces of wire that were difficult to remove and risked shorting the supply. I wish a dc connector was a world standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power supply plugs change frequently to stop us plugging the wrong one in, surely there is a better way to achieve that - perhaps by having a circuit to measure the incoming voltage and somehow complain if what ever is connected is outside the specified range.&lt;/p&gt;
