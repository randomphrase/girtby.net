		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve never used this software myself, but I have been reading hydrogenaudio.org (where double-blind testing is a bit of a hot topic) for a long time, and did do a tiny bit of stats a long time ago. So I may be wrong but when you say &quot;it really did feel like guessing&quot; then you&#039;re very close to the truth since I think you really want to be getting 7 out 8 to establish that it&#039;s not just random chance. Or even better doing more trials to give it more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ABX&quot;&gt;HydrogenAudio wiki&lt;/a&gt; suggests that doing 16 trials and getting 13 correct is the minimum before you can conclude that you&#039;re not just guessing:&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks dave, good points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would only say that just because it feels like guessing doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s random. There may be some difference which is detectable only at a subconscious level. In other words, even if I am not capable of articulating what the difference is, I may still be capable of detecting that there is a difference. Human perception is a funny thing.&lt;/p&gt;
