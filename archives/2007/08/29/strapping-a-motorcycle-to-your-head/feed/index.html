		<description>&lt;p&gt;For a cheap foray into audiophile-ism.. check out a pair of Grado SR80 headphones with a CMOY headphone amp (I like the ones made of Altoid tins.. you can get them on EBAY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for about $130, you can have superb headphone audio.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a good combo, Corey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first foray into decent headphones was courtesy of a pair of Grado SR-60s. They look very old-school, like they should be worn by the radio operator aboard a Landcaster bomber. But they sounded great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear that Grados are actually hard to get outside the US nowadays and instead are marketed under the Allessandro brand, although the relationship between the two is unclear to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of CMOY-or-not really depends on the source, IMHO. I think iPods sound pretty good really and don&#039;t need amping at the lower end of the price range (meaning you&#039;re better off spending the amp money on a better set of headphones). But if you&#039;re sourcing from crappy PC audio, then sure go for the CMOY. I really like the Move because it has a USB input which allows PC audio to be bypassed completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just because I haven&#039;t yet gained complete coverage of Dan&#039;s site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansdata.com/cmoy.htm&quot;&gt;here is his review&lt;/a&gt; of the Altoids CMOY amplifier, complete with cool pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for a great roundup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get enormous pleasure out of my shortened Sure in ear headphones combined with an iPod shuffle. (I fill it randomly from my library, then delete a few and drag podcasts to listen to up the top of the list).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, following Dan&#039;s recommendation, I enjoy a pair of Senheiser HD212Pros but I can&#039;t bring myself to walk the streets wearing them as some do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrigued about the amplifier idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marxy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, that reminds me, did you read about the bad &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/327319_mp3sound13.html?source=mypi&quot;&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt; of highly compressed audio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best thing we can do is listen to audio that hasn&#039;t had the &quot;non essential&quot; frequencies removed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Marxy, I for one support your stance on the Shures, they certainly don&#039;t make you look like a dork when walking the streets, unlike the full-size headphones. Maybe some hipsters can pull off the full-size headphone fashion statement, but not me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too impressed with your article on compression though. Yes overly-compressed audio sounds bad, but in that case just turn up the bitrate, surely? I contend that even with the best audio equipment and the most critical listeners you&#039;d be very hard pressed to tell the difference between a high-bitrate MP3/AAC and the uncompressed original. In fact, I was alluding to this in the final paragraph of the article; I found some software to perform blind testing of uncompressed versus compressed (i.e MP3) audio. I&#039;m sure the results will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw your comment I thought you were talking about a completely different type of compression; namely dynamic range compression, about which there was an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/aug07/5429&quot;&gt;IEEE Spectrum article&lt;/a&gt; recently. I don&#039;t want to spoil it for you, but let&#039;s just say that compressed audio did not start with the digital revolution. I, for one, had no idea. Fascinating read, do not miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;If you liked that article, you should really read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/imperfect-sound-forever.htm&quot;&gt;Imperfect Sound Forever&lt;/a&gt;, a several-thousand-word article that explores the issue in a lot of depth. And don’t miss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/soulseeking/imperfect-sound-forever-revisited.htm&quot; title=&quot;Imperfect Sound Forever Revisited&quot;&gt;the (much shorter) followup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for headphones, a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cheap option I can recommend for its tremendous oomph for the buck is a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,256,pid,256,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html&quot;&gt;AKG K-55&lt;/a&gt;s. I have seen not one negative review of them so far, and with good reason. Despite their emphasis on the low frequencies, they stay true to the sound rather than bombarding you with bass, so they don’t sound boomy or farty at all. At the same time treble is crisp and the middles avoid muddiness, so even though they’re closed and well-isolating ’phones, they sound rather open. Those things are one of my best purchase decisions ever. For people with small budgets, they are an excellent way to get more out of music.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wise man once told me that he deliberately avoided cultivating expensive tastes, because they are ultimately unsatisfying unless you are uncommonly wealthy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late great American sportswriter, Red Smith, once said: &quot;Never invest in anything that needs painting or feeding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your review almost makes me reconsider headphones.  I never much liked listening to music that way.  The bass thump in the chest is important, and the super-stereo effect can sometimes be annoying.  Mostly, though, headphones make me jittery -- paranoid about who might be sneaking up behind me, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I&#039;m in a new neighborhood, and it&#039;s a LOT louder than my last few.  I may go the headphone route yet.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ve prodded me to build a high quality headphone amp and I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://marxy.org/2007/09/ultra-high-quality-headphone-amplifier.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that it really makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, I went and did some tests on CD audio converted to AAC at 128 and 256Kbps. I&#039;ve decoded the audio and intercut ten seconds of each and put them up as an AIF file &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mac.com/petermarxy/Intercut128-256.aif&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this track isn&#039;t a good choice, but to be honest I don&#039;t think I could pick between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&#039;m all interested in choice of music to evaluate Hi Fi components. Any recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;
