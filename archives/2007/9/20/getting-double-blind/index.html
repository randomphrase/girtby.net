		        <h3>Getting Double-Blind 
		        </h3>
		        <p>So in my discussion about <a href="/archives/2007/8/29/strapping-a-motorcycle-to-your-head">headcycles</a> I alluded to the possibility of detecting audio compression flaws with my fancy new equipment. By this I mean artifacts that are introduced as a result of the lossy process that squeezes audio into MP3s, AACs and so forth. I decided to conduct a double-blind test on myself to test that hypothesis.</p>

<p><span id="more-1987"></span></p>

<h4>Methodology and Apparatus</h4>

<p>Like any good amateur scientist I wanted to devise an experiment which would allow me to test my hypothesis. And by &#8220;devise an experiment&#8221; I mean &#8220;trawl the internet for software which might be suitable&#8221;. After a bit, <a href="http://ff123.net/abchr/abchr.html">I found some</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called ABC/HR, and it is designed mainly for conducting large-scale quality evaluation of audio codecs. This is almost but not quite what I wanted. I didn&#8217;t want to evaluate the codec, I wanted to evaluate my equipment and my listening ability. Subtle difference.</p>

<p>Fortunately however ABC/HR has an &#8220;ABX&#8221; mode. This is apparently supposed to train the user to identify the differences between two similar samples. It allows you to select two samples A and B and randomly chooses one of these to be X. You have to listen to the samples and determine which of these is X. The test is repeated a certain number of times.</p>

<p>During the test you get to switch at any time between A, B, and X. Playback is continuous, meaning that if you switch to a different sample it will continue where the first sample left off (modulo some occasional audio glitches).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/09/abx-test-screenshot.png" alt="ABX test screenshot" title="abx-test-screenshot" width="346" height="418" class="size-full wp-image-3726 lede" />There is a fair bit of theory here which I can&#8217;t be bothered with, and hence will happily refer you to the references cited on the ABC/HR site for more information. But somehow from this theory and some configuration parameters it produces results in the form of probabilities that you falsely accept that A is different from, or the same as, B. See the screenshot for an example.</p>

<p>I did this test using the following test tracks, chosen more or less at random from the <a href="/archives/2005/10/8/a-cd-see">plastic reciepts</a> that were easily accessible at the time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Race:In by Battles, an instrumental rock number</li>
<li>Tabula Rasa, a great modern classical piece by the Estonian composer Avro P&auml;rt</li>
<li>Camping Next To Water by Badly Drawn Boy, kindof indie/folk I guess</li>
<li>Every Planet We Reach Is Dead by Gorrilaz, a pop song more or less</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these I ripped from CD using two different methods. First, the uncompressed .WAV file using the latest version of <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a>. Second, a compressed 128 Kbps AAC file using the latest iTunes. The latter was converted to a .WAV for the purpose of the test using FAAD2.</p>

<p>I set up test files for each of the songs and loaded them up in ABC/HR, and settled in for a bit of a listen, with a beverage to aid concentration.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Here are the results. P1 is the probability of falsely accepting that &#8220;A is different from B&#8221;. P2 is the probability of falsely accepting that &#8220;A is the same as B&#8221;. In each case A was the uncompressed sample, and B the compressed sample.</p>

<div><table border="1">
<tr><th align="left">Song</th><th>Correct Trials</th><th>P1</th><th>P2</th></tr>
<tr><td>Race:In</td><td>5 of 8</td><td>0.363</td><td>0.005</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tabula Rasa</td><td>4 of 8</td><td>0.637</td><td>&lt; 0.001</td></tr>
<tr><td>Camping</td><td>6 of 8</td><td>0.145</td><td>0.038</td></tr>
<tr><td>Every Planet</td><td>4 of 8</td><td>0.637</td><td>&lt; 0.001</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I can also report by way of results that I found the test <em>extremely</em> difficult. In a lot of cases it really did feel like guessing. I tried initially to pick out individual artifacts in the compressed sample, but quickly decided that it was too hard. For most of the tests I was simply trying to intuit the right answer based on an overall impression of the sample.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>

<p>As you can see I didn&#8217;t get many trials right. The probabilities however are the most interesting part.</p>

<p>For a couple of the songs I had a better than even probability of falsely accepting the compressed version as different to the uncompressed. For the other two, the probability dropped below 0.5. I&#8217;m not sure if you can simply average these probabilities though so I won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>However there does seem to be a pretty good trend on the second set of probabilities. In other words it seems that I am extremely unlikely to falsely accept that the two samples are the same.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I think this all means that I can notice some very marginal difference, but there&#8217;s really not a lot in it. So, based on the results, and the experience of actually conducting the test, I feel no need to re-rip all of my 128Kbps AAC files. I might rip future CDs at 160Kbps just to give a bit of extra headroom, but after that it&#8217;s just a waste of space/bandwidth.</p>

<p>An alternative conclusion might be that I need to buy even more expensive headphones, so that I <em>can</em> hear the AAC compression artifacts! Yeah, that&#8217;s it.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never used this software myself, but I have been reading hydrogenaudio.org (where double-blind testing is a bit of a hot topic) for a long time, and did do a tiny bit of stats a long time ago. So I may be wrong but when you say &#8220;it really did feel like guessing&#8221; then you&#8217;re very close to the truth since I think you really want to be getting 7 out 8 to establish that it&#8217;s not just random chance. Or even better doing more trials to give it more data.</p>

<p>They <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ABX">HydrogenAudio wiki</a> suggests that doing 16 trials and getting 13 correct is the minimum before you can conclude that you&#8217;re not just guessing:</p>

				<p>Thanks dave, good points.</p>

<p>I would only say that just because it feels like guessing doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s random. There may be some difference which is detectable only at a subconscious level. In other words, even if I am not capable of articulating what the difference is, I may still be capable of detecting that there is a difference. Human perception is a funny thing.</p>
