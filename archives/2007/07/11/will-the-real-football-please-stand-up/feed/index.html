		<description>&lt;p&gt;Aussie Rules football already has an alternative name in Australia: Aerial Ping-Pong.  Presumably this was coined by soccer fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After recent news reports about what the Rugby League players get up to on their nights off, &quot;Rapist League&quot; has a certain bitter truth to it, but I can&#039;t see it catching on.  &quot;Thugby League&quot; and &quot;Thugby Union&quot; are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Football already has a good-enough name too: Gridiron.  Although if you wanted to call it &quot;Bloody-Big-Pansies-In-Their-Boofy-Padded-Armour-So-They-Don&#039;t-Mess-Up-Their-Perms Ball&quot; then I can see that having a certain validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly it&#039;s all thuggery.  Cricket is the only ball game worth any attention at all.  It&#039;s always amusing the way Baseball fans act as if their statistics and histories are somehow impressive, when one shortish eighty-seven-day game of Cricket can generate more statistics and analyses than everything Willy Mays and Babe Ruth ever did...&lt;/p&gt;
