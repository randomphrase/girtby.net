		<description>&lt;p&gt;I must say, you have an almost impeccable taste in music! Last.fm is such a great service; as is Facebook. I haven&#039;t found an urge to start twittering yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Asbjørn, you are too kind. Thankyou for overlooking The Wiggles in my music stats. Although in the interest of full disclosure I should say that the play count for &quot;Intergalactic&quot; by the Beastie Boys is also artificially inflated courtesy of the Jr. Girtbys. They just love the bit that goes &quot;Beastie Boys don&#039;t let the beat ..... NNNNNDROP!&quot;. As do I.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;That &quot;let the beat... drop&quot; bit is even better when you&#039;ve heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Beastie-Boys/The-New-Style.html&quot;&gt;the track they sampled it from&lt;/a&gt; (lyrics sites are full of mondegreens, so take their transcription with a grain of salt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn seems to be another place where all the cool suits are hanging out now too... as incongruous as that sounds. It&#039;s certainly not a MySpace/Facebook killer, and I can&#039;t see 14 year olds flocking to it, but it does seem to have what it takes for some interesting job search-related networking. It&#039;s a bit like a game of 6 degrees but with business cards.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Alastair,
Apparently, I&#039;m sitting in your old seat at your old company, between Chris &amp; Julian.
They all say nice things about you.&lt;/p&gt;
