		<description>&lt;p&gt;My hand-written notes are hopeless.  Partly, this is because my handwriting sucketh, but I also find that when I&#039;m really engaged in a meeting I am so focussed on the discussion that I completely neglect to put pen to paper at the right moment to accurately capture the decision, problem or action I need to recall.  I have to say that making a note of problems isn&#039;t something I&#039;ve consciously thought of before.  I also have a nasty habit of abbreviating my notes to get back to the discussion, making them even more inscrutable when a couple more words could have turned them into the Gettysburg Address of notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to only note problems if they&#039;re directly or indirectly my responsibility.  If they&#039;re my problem, they&#039;re filed under action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I do manage to capture notes on paper, I use a couple of symbols to call out important items on the page.  &quot;A&quot; with a box around it is an action, usually for me unless I write someone else&#039;s name there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &quot;*&quot; means something important -- like a decision or a revelation.  Duh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use my paper notepad as a capture device, and reference -- but I&#039;ve taken to working out of EverNote and Todoist for long-term capture, prioritization and progress tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ever finish catching up on Battlestar Galactica I&#039;ll enthuse about them at length.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Listen also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manager-tools.com/2007/07/how-to-take-notes/&quot;&gt;Manager Tools: How to Take Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Mike and Mark&#039;s main point: if you write down only the things you should, you can slow down and write legibly. Then they tell you which bits to write down. It&#039;s a good match for Alastair&#039;s list. What happened when? Who will do what by when?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been working hard on my notetaking, and found that taking notes has major suckage. There are two things that notes are good for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remembering and understanding what it is you&#039;re all talking about during the meeting and about 20 minutes afterwards: &quot;Note: Enter base, kill mans&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowing other people down and repeating what they&#039;re saying in a nutshell: &quot;So what you&#039;re saying is, you want to enter my base and kill my mans&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes are worthless about an hour after they&#039;re written. Giving a date doesn&#039;t help, because as a &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; it&#039;s not useful (at least, I don&#039;t think &quot;what were we discussing on the 25th?&quot;, I think &quot;What do we do after entering my base again?&quot;). Any good notes will be all over the place, and will need to be re-written (which I highly advocate, probably in a digital format). However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like your Problem/Decision/Action paradigm a lot, which I think will help organise meeting notes a fair bit. I think these three items feed into other systems, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes are supposed to be good for &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, not for &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt;. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; translate them into another format to make sure the data you gleaned becomes information, whether it&#039;s an email, a wiki, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, disagree with the first two points, agree with the last three. Additional points include making a big deal of what you&#039;re writing in the book to slow the meeting down and get people to think, and understanding that if it&#039;s in the book, you&#039;re probably never going to read it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen on PDAs being the anus of note taking.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with much of your philosophy, Alastair.  I, too, use a spiral-bound notebook and start each entry with the date.  I usually use a heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that just writing, even scribbling, stuff down makes it stick in my memory much better.  Also, once I write something in the notebook, it seems easy to find, the next time I flip through -- all kinds of weird memory stuff happening that may not apply for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, a bit, with Sunny about writing things up/transcribing the notes.  For me, that really helps it stick in memory, and also improves my understanding.  But I don&#039;t think notes are worthless, and further, I have long remembered something I heard once about writing down directions: never through away your original notes, even if you rewrite them.  There is something about the cues that are present when reading the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a notebook near the computer is the ultimate backup.  Things don&#039;t crash nearly as much anymore, but being able to refer to error codes and recovery instructions is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I wish I could go back in time, and learn how to take shorthand.  The one thing bad about notes is that writing stuff down can be distracting, especially during meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
