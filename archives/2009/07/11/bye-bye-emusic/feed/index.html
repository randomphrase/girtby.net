		<description>&lt;p&gt;Richard: yeah I have no idea what&#039;s going on. All the spam you are seeing is not being caught by the spam filter, which is otherwise working fine and catching lots of fucking spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don&#039;t know why some of it gets through. I suppose I could turn on manual approval of spam, but that&#039;s possibly even more annoying (for me). Or CAPTCHA (shudder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly I&#039;m losing interest in the whole blog thing altogether. Or at least, I&#039;m more interested in other things these days. I&#039;d blog about this, except ... well...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;If only Jamendo had artists on the Warp label - but since Jamendo looks to be a freebie site, the whole concept of even minor label artists being on there seems like it would be a rare thing. But man, they don&#039;t even have any NIN, and he&#039;s giving his stuff away these days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: you have to do something about your comments RSS feed, Alastair. It&#039;s clearly being published before your (manual?) spam filter kicks in, and it&#039;s really starting to bug me. So. Much. Noise.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Jamendo now has an excellent website, and all of their music is creative commons, which means you can listen to it and pay for it when you want. You might want to give that a shot (you&#039;ll get different artists, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea that if you were to remix or use the music in your own videos / whatever, you could do that.&lt;/p&gt;
