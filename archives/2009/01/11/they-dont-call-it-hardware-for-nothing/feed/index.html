		<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m 40 and just completed My Clifford.. 
he was my first little electronic thingy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt lost most of the way but found a couple of pages that really helped me in trying to find out what resister was the one to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://samengstrom.com/nxl/10116/5&#95;band&#95;resistor&#95;color&#95;code&#95;page.en.html
the above page really helped me sort out which was which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as they pretty much looked the same to me).. 
Plus i might need a magnifying glass to see the lines better.. 
(gosh i might be getting old - ack!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps the diodes look fine..  on the instructions it said A was the positive side and K was negative..  so it looks like you have them the right way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine works pretty good.. just i was hopping for a better sounding chirp..
hope i have helped in some way ..  Cheers Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a stretch, but did you check the errata on the Silicon Chip web site? http://siliconchip.com.au/cms/A&#95;104479/article.html&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;On the subject of DealExtreme, as on many other subjects, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2008/09/26/never-mind-the-quality-feel-the-price/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; has worthwhile things to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin: I have no idea why your comment got marked as spam. I use the Akismet distributed spam detection system which I was moderately happy with the two false positives. I &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2008/07/31/bayes-theorem-1-mandatory-filtering-0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hate&lt;/a&gt; false positives. Not sure what I&#039;m going to do about it, but I know I&#039;m &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; reluctant to implement CAPTCHA or any other nonsense  like that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You&#039;re better off removing the transistors from the circuit to test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to testing voltages at various points, if it&#039;s not marked on the circuit, you&#039;ll need to calculate the expected voltage at various points based on the circuit diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(On another note....any idea why my comment got flagged as spam?  Was it due to the fact that I had an embedded URL in the text...or was it something else?)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Apologies to marxy and Martin, whose comments I had to rescue from the spam bin... :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@marxy: I saw that errata; it had been applied to the diagram supplied in the kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Martin: I also saw that hint (and in fact linked to it in the post!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve got a circuit diagram but am not really familiar enough with reading it to know how to do troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, how do I read it to know what the voltage should be at various points? Also, if I want to test a transistor in-situ, is that even possible? (Current theory is that I&#039;ve fried one of them while soldering).&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Sunny: Nup, I&#039;m pretty sure the circles are there to remind you to mount the component vertically, as I have done with the resistors. For whatever reason I didn&#039;t mount the diodes vertically as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;If the &quot;A&quot; denotes the &quot;anode&quot;, then what do the circles mean? Could it be possible that the &quot;A&quot; simply means that the &lt;em&gt;circle&lt;/em&gt; is the anode (as oppposed to &quot;K&quot; and a circle)?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Err, which one? Both have the non-striped end aligned with the A (for Anode) markers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;One of your diodes looks the wrong way around.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Without a circuit diagram for clifford, it&#039;s a bit hard to troubleshoot it remotely ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconchip.com.au/cms/A&#95;102711/article.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, some things to check include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check that you haven&#039;t transposed Q1 and Q2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check the orientation of D1 and D2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check your resistors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that the silicon chip page is wrong when it says
&lt;i&gt;&quot;the anode (A) is the end of the diode with the stripe. Both anodes for D1 and D2 should be toward the 3.3kΩ resistor.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
The anode is the end of the diode &lt;b&gt;without&lt;/b&gt; the stripe!  Assuming the screen printing on the top of the PCB is correct, then both your diodes are oriented correctly.)&lt;/p&gt;
