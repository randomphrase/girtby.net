		<description>&lt;p&gt;I always enjoy learning what other people think about Amazon Web Services and how they use them. Check out my very own tool CloudBerry Explorer that helps to 
manage S3 on Windows . It is a freeware. http://cloudberrylab.com/&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I put http://blog.quaddmg.com as my site, because I figured I&#039;d probably want to use my domain name for something else, and I&#039;d be too cheap to buy a whole other DNS entry. My choice appears to have been more useful than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to take this time to say to you systems engineers: This was the problem you were trying to solve!&lt;/p&gt;
