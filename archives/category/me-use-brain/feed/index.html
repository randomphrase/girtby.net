			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">prominent</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001044.html">bloggers</a> have recently asked the question &#8220;Why don&#8217;t people care about freedom 0?&#8221; To me this just raises the question &#8220;What is this freedom 0 stuff anyway?&#8221; Herewith the (lengthy) results of my own attempts to find out the answers to both of these questions, and even raise some of my own.</p>

<p><span id="more-2572"></span></p>

<h4>Free Software</h4>

<p>Freedom 0 is one of four &mdash; numbered zero through three of course &mdash; necessary and sufficient preconditions for software to be considered Free Software by the Free Software Foundation. The FSF publishes a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">definitive document</a> on this subject which is my reference for the remainder of this article.</p>

<p>As with any discussion about freedom, we are concerned here with what is <em>permissible</em>, not what is technically possible. Hence compliance to the &#8220;numbered&#8221; freedoms (as I shall call them), or to Free Software as a whole, is entirely determined by laws and licensing, <em>not</em> by the code. Perhaps &#8220;Free License&#8221; might be a better term for what is being defined, but no matter. It is assumed that for each piece of software under consideration, there is a single unambiguous license accompanying it; dual-licensed software is not discussed.</p>

<p>Also not discussed in the FSF document, is the significance of the ordering of the freedoms, even though there does seem to be some, because later numbered freedoms depend on earlier ones. The freedom to distribute your modifications to some software (freedom 3) is necessarily dependent on the freedom to make modifications in the first place (freedom 1), for example.</p>

<p>One possible reading of the FSF&#8217;s document is that freedom 0 exists not because it&#8217;s a worthwhile concept in its own right, but because it helps to <em>explain</em> a larger concept, namely that of Free Software. This provides one possible reason why people don&#8217;t care about freedom 0 in isolation of the others, but because of the ordering property I don&#8217;t think this is the case. Freedom 0 is, at first glace anyway, a worthwhile property that deserves further exploration.</p>

<h4>Defining Freedom 0</h4>

<p>Freedom 0 is the &#8220;freedom to run the software, for any purpose&#8221;. The FSF elaborates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity. In this freedom, it is the <em>user&#8217;s</em> purpose that matters, not the <em>developer&#8217;s</em> purpose; you as a user are free to run a program for your purposes, and if you distribute it to someone else, she is then free to run it for her purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reiterating, this freedom is all about what is <em>permissible</em>. If the license allows me to run the software on any computer system it satisfies freedom 0, regardless of whether or not the software actually runs on that system.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, freedom 0 is not <em>in itself</em> concerned with the freedom to actually modify the software in order to run it on any system; that&#8217;s freedom 1. So if we&#8217;re considering freedom 0 <em>only</em>, then the question can be practically reduced to &#8220;am I free to run this software on all <em>technically compatible</em> systems?&#8221; Only after freedom 1 is granted does the full meaning of freedom 0 come into effect.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>Being a nerd, the scene from <cite>Life of Brian</cite> where they discuss &#8220;every man&#8217;s right to have babies&#8221; is unwillingly brought to mind. If you&#8217;re a nerd too I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t need to recite it or make the connection to the topic at hand; let&#8217;s just take it as read. If you&#8217;re not a nerd &#8230; umm &#8230; congratulations on making it this far!</p></div>

<p>As a thought experiment you could imagine a closed-source developer who wanted to get the kudos of having a freedom 0-compatible license. They could deliberately <em>introduce technical dependencies</em> which would, in a sense, take the heat off the license limitations. By artificially limiting the range of compatible computer systems, such as with a hardware dongle for example, they could produce software that would be theoretically freedom 0-compatible, and yet highly constraining on the user thanks to technical limitations. OK, so this is a pretty fanciful scenario, but it does reinforce the point <a href="/archives/2007/12/20/code-2-0">made in Lessig&#8217;s Code 2.0 book</a> that licensing and code operate together to regulate behaviour.</p>

<p>So this provides another reason why people may not care too much about freedom 0, namely the technical limitations kick in before the licensing restrictions do. When this happens, freedom 1 is required, but that&#8217;s a different question.</p>

<h4>Further Subtleties</h4>

<p>OK so this definition of freedom 0 is already quite subtle and complex (and hence another possible reason why people don&#8217;t care about it), but in addition, there are other passages in the Free Software document that seem to apply to the numbered freedoms individually, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license, without your doing anything to give cause, the software is not free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The application of this to freedom 0 seems pretty straightforward. However, there are many other passages about the relationship between Free Software and commercial software, and their applicability to freedom 0 individually is less clear.</p>

<p>Does freedom 0 allow you to run <em>multiple copies</em> of a given piece of software on your own computer systems? In other words, does this freedom fundamentally conflict with the idea of commercial software licensing, at least as the latter is currently practiced? Freedom 2 talks about redistributing to your <em>neighbour</em>, but what about redistributing to yourself? It&#8217;s not clear.</p>

<p>There is apparently no conflict between commercial <em>distribution</em> and Free Software, so I guess that it might be conceivable that commercially-distributed software could also satisfy freedom 0. But at this point though I&#8217;m going to cop out and gloss over this aspect of freedom 0 for now.</p>

<h4>Some Examples</h4>

<p>Mac OS X does not satisfy freedom 0 because <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/macosx.html">according to the license</a> you are not permitted to run it on non-Apple hardware. Most annoyingly this includes <a href="/archives/2006/10/30/virtual-macos-x">virtual hardware</a>, although this restriction has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/01/17/macworld-ars-parallels-talks-about-2008-for-desktop-server">apparently</a> been relaxed in Mac OS X Server.</p>

<p>Until <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080121-microsoft-relents-vista-virtualization-ban-lifted.html">recently</a>, Microsoft had the same restriction on Vista which would preclude it from virtual hardware. Now that there is no restriction on the type of hardware that Vista can run on, is it compatible with freedom 0? Of course not; the Vista license is revocable. This may seem like a fairly theoretical concern, except that Microsoft <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/02/11/020211opfoster.html">have changed their license</a> in the past in order to restrict users.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easiest to think about freedom 0 in the context of operating systems because the &#8220;computer system&#8221; part reduces to &#8220;hardware&#8221;. But the same applies to applications: am I free to run this application on any other computer system (meaning, I suppose, a combination of operating system and hardware)? Is it permissible to run Internet Explorer on a Linux system, for example? <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/wine.html">Apparently not</a>.</p>

<p>These are important questions, but to my mind the it is the web applications that are the herd of elephants in the room. In many ways these have set back the cause of Free Software significantly, because it&#8217;s not even possible to <em>get</em> the software that powers most websites. If we truly cared about freedom 0 we would be clamouring for Google to release the code behind Gmail, for Yahoo to distribute the flickr code, and so on. I can think of lots of reasons why I would want to run these applications on my own servers, and very few technical reasons why I would not be able to do so.</p>

<h4>Won&#8217;t Someone Think Of The Freedoms?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve touched on some possible answers to the question &#8220;why don&#8217;t people care about freedom 0?&#8221; To recap:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It&#8217;s simply a device to explain the concept of Free Software, and is not a useful concept on its own.</strong> As discussed above, I don&#8217;t think this is right, but listed here for completeness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical restrictions often cut in way before the licensing ones do.</strong> This seems to be the case for the operating system examples listed above. The &#8220;lost&#8221; freedom 0 as a result of restrictive licensing doesn&#8217;t seem to have a huge impact on people. Instead the technical limitations are the main concern (though this would in turn put emphasis on freedom 1, which people seem similarly unconcerned about).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is all too hard.</strong> Yep.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other things are more important.</strong> The reason why you would want to raise awareness of freedom 0 is presumably to encourage its adoption in more software licenses. Commercial software and web applications are the most obvious candidates, and we should certainly be encouraging them to open up their licenses to allow us to run on more systems. But we could also encourage them to make their software better, like removing some of those technical limitations, or make the software more usable, or better documented, or better supported, or cheaper, or just prettier. People might understandably choose to advocate one of these instead of freedom 0.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think in most cases the last reason is probably the most likely, although the specifics will vary.</p>

<h4>More Important Than Free Software</h4>

<p>For my own view, freedom 0 and Free Software in general are certainly worthy causes, to be encouraged by all software developers and the community generally. But I&#8217;m more concerned about something else.</p>

<p>Why do we value Free Software over non-Free Software? Well, it prevents the authors of Free Software from taking away the software that we depend on, in order to access our <em>data</em>. But here the software is simply a means to an end. Ultimately I don&#8217;t particularly want to run Application X on Platform Y, what I really want to do is to <em>get my data out</em>. One way to do this is to actually run Application X on Platform Y, but another way is to run Application Z instead which has access to X&#8217;s data understands its data formats.</p>

<p>To me this seems more fundamental than freedom 0. It&#8217;s freedom -1, if you like. It&#8217;s about the freedom to <em>change</em> software whenever I feel like it. I demand this freedom to extract <em>my</em> data from <em>your</em> (hypothetical your) data store; retaining all the semantics, markup, and resolution; and not polluted by any excessive implementation artifacts. I demand to be able to do this at any time and without justification.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not about Free Software, it&#8217;s about Free Data. I&#8217;ve <a href="/archives/2006/12/26/atomexport">banged on</a> about this before, but with apparently little effect.</p>

<p>So <strong>forget freedom 0, why don&#8217;t people care about Free Data?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/2007/12/code-20.gif" alt="Cover of Code 2.0 by Lawrence Lessig" title="code-20" width="91" height="140" class="size-full wp-image-3733 lede" />So I recently finished Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s <a href="http://codev2.cc/">Code 2.0</a> and I am compelled to pass some sort of comment on it. Book reviews aren&#8217;t really my strength, but this one definitely deserves attention of some sort.</p>

<p>First the easy stuff. This book is a new edition of an earlier book with the obvious title. The changes and updates have been through an interesting process whereby the entire text of the book was posted on a wiki and anonymous contributions were invited to produce the successor. This might make you a bit wary about the overall continuity and structure of the book but I&#8217;m happy to report this is not a problem at all. Follow the link above and you&#8217;ll note that the entire text of the book is still available online, and indeed contributions are currently being sought for Code 3.0.</p>

<p>As you might expect from a Creative Commons founder, Lessig is putting his money where his mouth is by putting it all online under a CC license. Notwithstanding this, you&#8217;ll probably want a paper version. I bought my copy through my usual source, the <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0465039146">Book Depository</a> (£8.40 shipped anywhere).</p>

<p>OK so it&#8217;s already an interesting book, but what is it about? (You may be wondering) Let me see if I can do it some kind of justice.</p>

<p><span id="more-2279"></span></p>

<p>For me the book is an extended but highly thought-provoking discussion of the interaction between technology and law, underpinned by an impeccable understanding of both. A key concept that Lessig introduces early on in the book is the idea that regulation of human behaviour occurs through four &#8220;modalities&#8221; of control operating together in varying degrees.</p>

<p>These modalities are: the law, social norms, markets, and &#8220;code&#8221;. The latter term obviously invokes the world of the internet primarily, but the same principles extend quite elegantly into real-space by simple substitution of the term &#8220;architecture&#8221;.</p>

<p>In any given situation, our behaviour is regulated by one or more of these modalities. He uses the example of breaking into your neighbours&#8217; house to steal his new TV, obviously bad behaviour that we wish to regulate. The obvious reason why you don&#8217;t engage in this sort of behaviour is because it is illegal and you face punishment if you do. But <em>in addition</em> social norms also act to restrain you in a similar manner. The market exerts a kind of restraint because if you can afford a new TV yourself, you&#8217;ll hopefully be more motivated to just go and buy it yourself instead of stealing it from your neighbour. The last modality at work here is of course the architecture of your physical environment, which includes physical barriers (locks on the doors &amp; windows) that also act as a constraint on your behaviour. The combined effect of these modalities is that your neighbour&#8217;s TV is kept safe.</p>

<p>The bulk of the book explores how the different modalities interact, and how governments can and should regulate behaviour by manipulation of each of these, particularly online.</p>

<p>A key premise is the (quite easily observable) fact that on the Internet, code dominates most of the other modalities of control. For example, the reason why you can&#8217;t post <a href="/archives/2005/8/1/i-censorbot">defamatory content</a> in comments on this blog is that I will delete them and (if you persist) block you. The same applies to spam, albeit with reduced efficiency.</p>

<p>However, my reasons for blocking you are crucially <em>not</em> informed by any kind of constitutional values. And while that may be OK for my humble blog, it is almost certainly not in the general case. A key theme which resonated with me is the degree to which online behaviour is increasingly being regulated by code under the control of private interests.</p>

<p>The book spends considerable time exploring the nature and degree to which the existing US constitutional institution is challenged by technology. The concept of &#8220;latent ambiguity&#8221; is introduced, where technology has evolved to force an ambiguity in constitutional principles that the framers had never envisioned. This is explored in issues relating to <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/codev2/index.cgi?intellectual_property">intellectual property</a>, <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/codev2/index.cgi?privacy">privacy</a>, and <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/codev2/index.cgi?free_speech">free speech</a> among others. Such ambiguities need to be resolved adequately before the government can adequately regulate behaviour through code.</p>

<p>This is pretty fascinating stuff if, like me, you have a passing interest in technology, society and the law. Whilst reading I found myself pausing many times to consider the ramifications of what Lessig was saying in the book.</p>

<p>Being an accomplished lawyer I would assume Lessig knows his law, but I can confirm that he is also extremely technology-savvy. It is scary at times how quickly he can explain deep technical issues and instantly distill relevance to society in general and the law in particular.</p>

<p>Because of the scope of the book he is necessarily explaining legal issues to a technical audience and vice versa. I&#8217;m happy to report considerable success at the former. He is a patient explainer of issues, leading the reader carefully through a background of objective historical and current facts to thoughtful analysis before venturing (with appropriate disclaimers) into opinion and speculation.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the book is an easy read. The issues are big and necessarily complex. I found myself sometimes having to reread sections and will probably re-read the book (probably when Code 3.0 comes out). There is a lot to digest and think about here.</p>

<p>If I had to criticise anything it would probably be that Lessig sometimes assumes too much familiarity with the US constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights. For foreigners like me, a quick refresher on these before reading the book will probably help.</p>

<p>Overall, a highly recommended book. Should definitely keep you busy over the holidays.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So in my discussion about <a href="/archives/2007/8/29/strapping-a-motorcycle-to-your-head">headcycles</a> I alluded to the possibility of detecting audio compression flaws with my fancy new equipment. By this I mean artifacts that are introduced as a result of the lossy process that squeezes audio into MP3s, AACs and so forth. I decided to conduct a double-blind test on myself to test that hypothesis.</p>

<p><span id="more-1987"></span></p>

<h4>Methodology and Apparatus</h4>

<p>Like any good amateur scientist I wanted to devise an experiment which would allow me to test my hypothesis. And by &#8220;devise an experiment&#8221; I mean &#8220;trawl the internet for software which might be suitable&#8221;. After a bit, <a href="http://ff123.net/abchr/abchr.html">I found some</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called ABC/HR, and it is designed mainly for conducting large-scale quality evaluation of audio codecs. This is almost but not quite what I wanted. I didn&#8217;t want to evaluate the codec, I wanted to evaluate my equipment and my listening ability. Subtle difference.</p>

<p>Fortunately however ABC/HR has an &#8220;ABX&#8221; mode. This is apparently supposed to train the user to identify the differences between two similar samples. It allows you to select two samples A and B and randomly chooses one of these to be X. You have to listen to the samples and determine which of these is X. The test is repeated a certain number of times.</p>

<p>During the test you get to switch at any time between A, B, and X. Playback is continuous, meaning that if you switch to a different sample it will continue where the first sample left off (modulo some occasional audio glitches).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/09/abx-test-screenshot.png" alt="ABX test screenshot" title="abx-test-screenshot" width="346" height="418" class="size-full wp-image-3726 lede" />There is a fair bit of theory here which I can&#8217;t be bothered with, and hence will happily refer you to the references cited on the ABC/HR site for more information. But somehow from this theory and some configuration parameters it produces results in the form of probabilities that you falsely accept that A is different from, or the same as, B. See the screenshot for an example.</p>

<p>I did this test using the following test tracks, chosen more or less at random from the <a href="/archives/2005/10/8/a-cd-see">plastic reciepts</a> that were easily accessible at the time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Race:In by Battles, an instrumental rock number</li>
<li>Tabula Rasa, a great modern classical piece by the Estonian composer Avro P&auml;rt</li>
<li>Camping Next To Water by Badly Drawn Boy, kindof indie/folk I guess</li>
<li>Every Planet We Reach Is Dead by Gorrilaz, a pop song more or less</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these I ripped from CD using two different methods. First, the uncompressed .WAV file using the latest version of <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a>. Second, a compressed 128 Kbps AAC file using the latest iTunes. The latter was converted to a .WAV for the purpose of the test using FAAD2.</p>

<p>I set up test files for each of the songs and loaded them up in ABC/HR, and settled in for a bit of a listen, with a beverage to aid concentration.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Here are the results. P1 is the probability of falsely accepting that &#8220;A is different from B&#8221;. P2 is the probability of falsely accepting that &#8220;A is the same as B&#8221;. In each case A was the uncompressed sample, and B the compressed sample.</p>

<div><table border="1">
<tr><th align="left">Song</th><th>Correct Trials</th><th>P1</th><th>P2</th></tr>
<tr><td>Race:In</td><td>5 of 8</td><td>0.363</td><td>0.005</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tabula Rasa</td><td>4 of 8</td><td>0.637</td><td>&lt; 0.001</td></tr>
<tr><td>Camping</td><td>6 of 8</td><td>0.145</td><td>0.038</td></tr>
<tr><td>Every Planet</td><td>4 of 8</td><td>0.637</td><td>&lt; 0.001</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I can also report by way of results that I found the test <em>extremely</em> difficult. In a lot of cases it really did feel like guessing. I tried initially to pick out individual artifacts in the compressed sample, but quickly decided that it was too hard. For most of the tests I was simply trying to intuit the right answer based on an overall impression of the sample.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>

<p>As you can see I didn&#8217;t get many trials right. The probabilities however are the most interesting part.</p>

<p>For a couple of the songs I had a better than even probability of falsely accepting the compressed version as different to the uncompressed. For the other two, the probability dropped below 0.5. I&#8217;m not sure if you can simply average these probabilities though so I won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>However there does seem to be a pretty good trend on the second set of probabilities. In other words it seems that I am extremely unlikely to falsely accept that the two samples are the same.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I think this all means that I can notice some very marginal difference, but there&#8217;s really not a lot in it. So, based on the results, and the experience of actually conducting the test, I feel no need to re-rip all of my 128Kbps AAC files. I might rip future CDs at 160Kbps just to give a bit of extra headroom, but after that it&#8217;s just a waste of space/bandwidth.</p>

<p>An alternative conclusion might be that I need to buy even more expensive headphones, so that I <em>can</em> hear the AAC compression artifacts! Yeah, that&#8217;s it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some half-arsed pseudo-philosophical ramblings follow. It starts with some musings on transistors and eventually circles around to show some relevance to current events, specifically the climate change debate. But be warned, it will take a while.</p>

<p><span id="more-1055"></span></p>

<h4>The Secret Life of Transistors</h4>

<p>When I was at university a professor said to me that there were probably only a handful of people in the world who understand how a transistor works. Such are the complexities of the science behind this seemingly simple device.</p>

<p>Many times in my software development career I had pondered this, particularly when confronted with a particularly nasty bug. In these circumstances I pride myself on being fairly unafraid of digging deep into the inner workings of the machine. I had the confidence to learn what I needed to know in order to successfully fix the problem, if not totally discover its root cause. However, knowing that the workings of the transistor were to all intents and purposes out of reach, was a somewhat sobering thought. Not that I have &mdash; to my knowledge anyway &mdash; faced any bugs that ultimately required an understanding of the transistor. But this limitation was always lurking there at the back of my mind.</p>

<p>In attaining maturity, I expect that everyone has a similar realisation. Given the finite amount of time that we all have available to us, there is no way that we can know everything about everything. So at some point we have to take things upon faith.</p>

<h4>The F Word</h4>

<p>Faith is possibly the wrong word because it involves belief in the absence of evidence. In the case of the transistor, all the facts are there for me to discover, but I simply don&#8217;t have the time to delve in there and discover them for myself. When the software crashes and I&#8217;m up against a deadline, I&#8217;m not going to reach for the physics textbook. So like most normal people, I accept certain facts &#8220;on faith&#8221;. Without direct knowledge, but with a certain amount of confidence in the word of others.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, even the experts in transistors will have to defer first to other scientists, and then ultimately to the limits of human knowledge in the fundamental workings of the universe. In practice, of course, you are unlikely to ever reach the limit of human knowledge in solving a problem. Instead you are likely to reach a point where highly specialised knowledge is required, requiring more in-depth study than is warranted by the problem at hand. Then you have to fall back on other techniques, if you are to proceed.</p>

<h4>The Quality of Information is Not Strain&#8217;d</h4>

<p>When it is impractical to acquire detailed knowledge for yourself, you are often forced to rely on the information of others. This in turn brings in a more subjective analysis of the information, relying on secondary indicators. For convenience I will refer to this as the act of assessing the <em>quality</em> of the information.</p>

<p>We all know how to assess the quality of the claims of others. You look at the motivations that cause people to say one thing over another. You look at their past history of credible reporting. You look at the level of respect showed by their peers. You look at whether their views are disputed or not. Whether or not anyone else has examined them critically. All the usual sorts of things.</p>

<p>What you&#8217;re chasing is an assessment of the quality of the information. You don&#8217;t <em>know</em> that it&#8217;s right based on empirical evidence and your expertise, instead you try to recognise the characteristics that correct information often exhibits. Note that I&#8217;m <em>not</em> talking about &#8220;truthiness&#8221;, where you&#8217;re ignoring all evidence and fundamentally relying on wishful thinking. I&#8217;m just saying that in practice critical thinking often involves relying on secondary indicators, in lieu of a detailed and objective analysis of the information itself.</p>

<h4>The Sceptical And The Na&iuml;ve</h4>

<p>With any subjective analysis, there is plenty of room for disagreement between individuals, when examining the same information. For example, you may think that the New York Times is a rag and not to be trusted, and be immediately suspicious of information published there. And of course I may think the opposite. However I would contend that with most qualitative judgements, broad consensus can be reached, even if only at the extremes. There would be, I imagine, very little disagreement that an average bottle of Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape was of superior quality than even the best bottle of Tyrell&#8217;s Long Flat Red, even amongst people who don&#8217;t drink wine often.</p>

<p>I think that the degree of scepticism we exhibit corresponds to our standards of acceptable information quality. Sceptical (perhaps critical is a better adjective) people will demand higher quality of information, and na&iuml;ve people will be satisfied with lower quality.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>It&#8217;s fiendishly hard to remove one&#8217;s own prejudice when assessing claims of others. If you are adverse to a given claim for whatever reason you&#8217;re going to naturally require a higher standard of proof from others. Likewise if you&#8217;re receptive to an idea, perhaps because it benefits you, you&#8217;re already predisposed to believe it. We are all susceptible to such wishful thinking, and resisting it requires a great degree of self-awareness.</p></div>

<p>Like all judgements they can of course be inconsistent, and this sometimes raises questions about the person making the judgement. If someone is presented with two objectively similar items, and they reject one &mdash; and only one &mdash; as low quality, you have to wonder if they know what they&#8217;re talking about. What criteria were they using to assess quality? For example, if someone tried to tell you that the <a href="/articles/2005/7/19/childhood-illusions-shattered">Aston Martin DB5 was a masterpiece</a>, but the DB6 was an automotive abomination on par with the Ford Pinto, you&#8217;d have to be wary about any vehicular advice they gave subsequently.</p>

<p>So it is with the subjective quality of information. I can understand being naive or being critical, but being alternately one then the other is not generally commendable behaviour.</p>

<h4>Analysis Paralysis</h4>

<p>There is however, at least one factor which might legitimately cause a person to lower their standards, and accept low-quality information. That factor is time.</p>

<p>When a course of action must be decided based on certain information, that information needs to be assessed up to the point when <em>lack of action</em> becomes the biggest risk. So if you&#8217;re being chased by a bear, there&#8217;s only so much time you can take to assess whether or not the bridge across the stream is safe. At some point you just have to cross the bridge, or swim the stream, regardless of how unsafe either alternative looks.</p>

<p>In decision making ideally you&#8217;d like to find a balance between the risks of inaction on the one hand, and the uncertainty of information on the other. As time increases, you get more information about the situation, but less time in which to act on it. You don&#8217;t want to act on incomplete information, but on the other hand you still need to act. It&#8217;s often a tricky call to decide when (or whether) to act based on incomplete information.</p>

<h4>And Now For Something Completely Topical</h4>

<p>For a long time our dear Prime Minister maintained that he was unsatisfied with the quality of information relating to climate change. Obviously he isn&#8217;t a climate scientist, but instead relies on an assessment of the information presented to him. For a long time he apparently had high standards of quality for such information.</p>

<p>Then one day he announced he was satisfied with the evidence and conceded that anthropomorphic climate change was a reality and that something needed to be done to reduce carbon emissions. In order to decide on a course of action so he had to assess the quality of the options available.</p>

<p>The information about the Prime Minister&#8217;s option for &#8220;clean&#8221; coal is of spectacularly low quality. It is almost completely unproven that it will work at all, let alone meet the required emission targets. (Nuclear power is, on the other hand, at least a <a href="/articles/2006/4/18/you-can-hug-your-children-with-nuclear-power">more-or-less known risk</a>, but let&#8217;s ignore it for now).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem though. The Prime Minister has <em>instantly</em> flipped from being overly sceptical to overly na&iuml;ve in a matter of months. He&#8217;s been sitting at the metaphorical roulette wheel all night trying to calculate the odds, and finally with seconds to go before closing he puts all his money on one number. In short, he was forced into risky courses of action by his scepticism. At least that was the stated reason.</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;ve all been in similar situations, albeit with far less severe consequences. In my business it can often occur with the <a href="/articles/2006/12/18/the-other-kind-of-reentrant">tricky bug</a>.</p>

<h4>Consistency Is a Virtue</h4>

<p>Time-constrained decisions are a special case though. If you can take the time constraints out of the equation, people should be held to a level of consistency in their judgements about the information presented to them. Like I said above, I think it is acceptable to be either sceptical or na&iuml;ve, as long as there is some degree of consistency.</p>

<p>When there is no such consistency, it is a pretty blatant indicator that other <a href="/articles/2004/11/2/media-by-us">biases are at work</a>. And that&#8217;s another explanation for the Prime Minister&#8217;s sudden change of heart on climate change, but that&#8217;s for you to judge&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some brief thoughts on <cite>The God Delusion</cite>, Richard Dawkins&#8217; latest book.</p>

<p>I was initially reluctant to read <cite>The God Delusion</cite>, on the assumption that it was going to tell me a lot of things I already know, and reinforce views I already have. And I assumed that it was just going to make me cross. Upon reading it, and re-reading it, I do commend this book to other atheists, wavering atheists, and especially to agnostics. And of course open-minded religious people. For me the surprises were:</p>

<ul>
<li>A systematic cataloguing of the dubious moral lessons contained in the bible;</li>
<li>A detailed demolition of the idea that science and religion occupy separate &#8220;magesteria&#8221;,  where each is entirely independent of the other;</li>
<li>Some interesting observations on the extent to which supposedly secular societies can bend over backwards to accommodate religious belief;</li>
<li>A fascinating chapter on the possible Darwinian explanations for the origins of religious belief as a near-universal human trait;</li>
<li>Popularising the term &#8220;American Taliban&#8221; to refer to fundamentalist Christians in the US;</li>
<li>Meditations on the extent to which our perceptions are drastically limited by our evolutionary legacy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter point culminates in a particularly inspiring passage at the end of the book. Dawkins channels Sagan in looking towards science to inspire us through new perceptions of the world.</p>

<p>Although there is plenty in the book that is contrary to established religion, Dawkins spends considerable time on the power of science to inspire and to &#8220;raise consciousness&#8221; (as he puts it). So it&#8217;s not all bashing the bible-bashers. But when doing so he is quite forthright and provocative. The title itself says it all, although I get the feeling he would have preferred &#8220;The God Hypothesis&#8221; as a title because that phrase occurs far more commonly in the book. Still he devotes some time to explaining his tactics, namely to avoid a confrontative debate with his opponents.</p>

<p>As evidenced by a recent <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,303,Reading-of-The-God-Delusion-in-Lynchburg-VA,Richard-Dawkins--C-SPAN2">appearance at a Lynchburg, VA university</a>, he is clearly not an aggressive man. He listens thoughtfully and responds succinctly and clearly. <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/images/LaurieTaylorNewHumanist.pdf">This article</a> in the New Humanist discusses Dawkins&#8217; tactics further with reference to that incident, and includes a highly telling response to one question: &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m rambling on about tactics because some of the reaction to the book has tried to paint the picture of a rising new force of &#8220;militant atheism&#8221;, lead by Dawkins and others. For example, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/02/news/letter.php">Richard Bernstein in the IHT</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1983820,00.html#article_continue">Tobias Jones in the Guardian</a>. These two use the term &#8220;militant atheism&#8221; and it is entirely unjustified. Dawkins strikes pre-emptively in the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I might retort that such hostility as I or other atheists occasionally voice towards religion is limited to words. I am not going to bomb anybody, behead them, stone them, burn them at the stake, crucify them, or fly planes into their skyscrapers, just because of a theological disagreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bar is set quite high for militancy.</p>

<p>Bernstein&#8217;s article exposes a bit of a blind spot with regards to religious militancy, claiming that unlike Islam, &#8220;Christian fundamentalism [engages] in no violence or threats.&#8221; Which of course makes me wonder if he&#8217;s even read the book he&#8217;s talking about. Dawkins writes at length about the threats he has personally received, and about the terrorists who kill doctors in the name of Christianity, and other modern-day examples. And what about George W. Bush&#8217;s claim that God told him to invade Iraq? Does that not count as Christian fundamentalism also?</p>

<p>Dawkins does not demand any action of his readers, except to help raise consciousness. He explicitly draws his tactics from the feminist movements who encouraged us to think about language and how it reinforces an undesirable mindset. He also makes parallels to the gay pride movement, trying to bring atheists out of the closet. Neither of these can be claimed to be militant by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>So please raise your consciousness, come out of the closet, and read <cite>The God Delusion</cite>. Or I&#8217;ll kill you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now most people who have had any dealings with a large institution will have been asked what their mother&#8217;s maiden name is.</p>

<p>The first time you encounter this, it makes you do a bit of a double-take and wonder how such information can be relevant to anyone. Look into it a bit further and you see they are simply trying to establish a method of authenticating you, probably as a backup for a password-based authentication system.</p>

<p>These secret questions, as I like to call them, are becoming more common. But there are many mistakes your institution can make in trying to implement them. In my dealings with a large Australian government website, I encountered many of them.</p>

<p>A war story follows.</p>

<p><span id="more-215"></span></p>

<h4>Secrets Of The Medicare Website</h4>

<div class="aside"><p>For any non-Australians reading, it should be pointed out that Medicare Australia is the government-run public health program. Unlike the US namesake everyone in Australia is likely to use their services. The ubiquity of this service, as well as the sensitivity of health-related information, should be kept in mind when reading below.</p></div>

<p>Logging into the <a href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/yourhealth/our_services/CoinHomepagePRD.htm">Medicare Online</a> website for the first time I was presented with a very intimidating form. After entering the password that they sent to me by mail, they wanted me to set up some secret questions and answers. No less than <em>five</em> secret questions, and I had to supply both the questions and the answers that would conform to their three bullet points of security:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For authentication purposes, please record 5 different Questions and Answers in the fields below. Questions and Answers are not case sensitive. For security and convenience please ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>your Answers are only known to yourself,</li>
  <li>your Answers are not related to your log on name and password, and</li>
  <li>the Answer is difficult for people to guess even if they see your questions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Example: What is my mothers maiden name?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sighing inwardly, I recalled a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,,99628,00.html">Schneier column</a> where he described the security problems of such secret questions. In short: the answers to secret questions are almost always easier to guess than passwords, and hence are a poor substitute or backup.</p>

<h4>Schneier&#8217;s Advice</h4>

<p>So upon seeing the 5 secret questions form, my first instinct was to create questions and answers as follows:</p>

<p>Question <em>n</em>: What is the answer to question <em>n</em>?
Answer <em>n</em>: (Title of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Random article from Wikipedia</a>.)</p>

<p>This requires me to remember those five random article titles forever in my password database. Along with the password I had created for the site. Grrr.</p>

<p>But then I read Schneier&#8217;s article linked above, and he convinced me otherwise. He described how he responded to secret questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My usual technique is to type a completely random answer &#8212; I madly slap at my keyboard for a few seconds &#8212; and then forget about it. This ensures that some attacker can&#8217;t bypass my password and try to guess the answer to my secret question, but is pretty unpleasant if I forget my password. The one time this happened to me, I had to call the company to get my password and question reset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#8217;s exactly what I did: bash at the keyboard for a bit and hit submit.</p>

<p>For the questions I selected &#8220;these&#8221;, &#8220;questions&#8221;, &#8220;are&#8221;, &#8220;really&#8221;, &#8220;stupid&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know why &#8212; I should have just typed gibberish for these as well as the answers &#8212; but this turned out to be a really good idea, as we shall see.</p>

<h4>Ask a Secret Question, Get a Secret Answer</h4>

<p>After setting up my 5 secret questions and answers, I discovered that in order to do anything useful on the Medicare website you need to apply for a &#8220;Higher Access Level&#8221;. And guess what you need to do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For your protection you are required to further prove who you are, by answering two of your secret questions and answers. When you are successful, you will be asked to enter your current Medicare card address as a final verification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my protection, two of the five questions were posed and awaited my response. In order to proceed, I needed to know exactly what was the jibberish I had entered a few seconds ago. An impossible task, surely? There&#8217;s no way I could reproduce the same sequence of keys on the keyboard. The Firefox AutoComplete feature was bringing back some jibberish, but apparently not the right jibberish.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>I think what was happening was this. The original secret Q&#038;A form had fields with names answer1 through answer5. The subsequent Higher Access Level form had fields with names answer1 and answer2. I think that Firefox was using my first two secret answers, regardless of the secret questions, and mostly getting them wrong. I suspect that I could have kept hitting refresh until it prompted me for secret question 1 and 2, and used the AutoCompleted answers.</p></div>

<p>After a bit of googling I found the <a href="http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/dumpautocomplete.htm">dumpAutoComplete</a> tool. This is a tool to mine the information in the AutoComplete database. When you submit a form, Firefox stores the contents of most string fields in this database. Unfortunately there&#8217;s no way to view the contents of this database from within Firefox. Instead I had to quit the browser, which wrote out the form data to disk, ran the dumpAutoComplete tool, and loaded it up in a text editor where a bit of visual grepping found the answer1 through answer5 fields and the corresponding jibberish. Because I had used identifiable questions, I was able to select the right answers from the form data.</p>

<p>This process was almost certainly quicker (and more pleasant) than calling Medicare and explaining the situation. I particularly dreaded explaining to a customer service rep why I couldn&#8217;t answer my own secret questions that I entered a few minutes earlier, on the advice of a world-renown security expert. So I was very relieved to get this information out of the browser autocomplete file.</p>

<h4>Security of Form Data</h4>

<p>Here is where we can see some security problems with Medicare&#8217;s implementation of secret question. Secret information can be entered into a <code>&lt;input type="password"&gt;</code> field and it can be assumed that the browser will keep the contents secure. Other form data such as <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> is not as secure and is handled differently.</p>

<p>For example, by default Firefox stores text form data in its database. It is possible to disable this globally, but not on a per-instance basis. On the other hand, each time a password is saved to the password database, the user is prompted. Password data is not shared across sites but other form data <em>is</em>. So I&#8217;m pretty sure I could easily retrieve secret answers from people by using a phishing site and relying on AutoComplete to do the rest.</p>

<p>In short, the secret answers should be secured as passwords are, namely in <code>&lt;input type="password"&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4>Don&#8217;t Like That Question? Here&#8217;s Another</h4>

<p>It should be reiterated that at the point I attempted to upgrade to Higher Access Level I was already logged in. The initial login password had been sent by mail, and on first login I had been prompted to change the password. The website had <em>verified</em> that my new password met some arbitary complexity criteria.</p>

<p>And yet Medicare had assumed that the level of security afforded by all these checks was not sufficient because they also asked the secret questions when upgrading.</p>

<p>In fact it&#8217;s worse than this, because they asked two of the five original secret questions, picked <em>at random</em>. I played with this a while, just hitting refresh was enough to cause the website to pick a different pair of questions to ask. This means that if all I know are the answers to two out of the five questions, I can just hit refresh until those two questions are presented, and I&#8217;m in. It&#8217;s like having five locks on a door, but allowing the door to be opened by picking any two of them.</p>

<h4>Secret Questions As A &#8220;Better&#8221; Password</h4>

<p>The idea that secret questions should be used as an additional level of authentication is a suspect one because in general, there is no reason to suspect that secret questions are more secure than passwords.</p>

<p>The main problem is that even the &#8220;difficult to guess&#8221; secret answers are nowhere near difficult enough to guess, as mentioned in Schneier&#8217;s article. But I think there are other problems.</p>

<p>Due to the difficulty of formulating the questions, it is highly likely that questions such as the canonical mother&#8217;s maiden name will be reused multiple institutions which use the same secret question approach. In other words multiple organisations will have access to this shared secret information. This is unlike a password where it is possible (and recommended) to use unique credentials for each.</p>

<p>Also, the secret questions and answers typically <em>cannot be changed</em>. This seems to be true for the Medicare site, and likely others as well. By definition the secret answer must be easy to remember, hence static. So if you find your secret question compromised (eg such as might happen if your mother divorces and reverts to her maiden name) you need to choose a different secret question. (And remember to never use it again subsequently)</p>

<p>So we have a system of authentication where the secrets are commonly shared across multiple organisations and cannot easily be changed. Are the warning bells going off yet?</p>

<h4>User-Selected Questions</h4>

<p>The Medicare system might seem, at first glance, to be better than most secret question authentication schemes because it lets the user create their own questions. After all they can potentially ask really obscure questions. But let&#8217;s think about it for a moment.</p>

<p>Firstly, it&#8217;s <em>hard</em> to think up a question and answer pair which satisfies the requirements of being easier to remember than passwords, but not guessable or knowable by others. For example, I could use &#8220;what is my favourite TV show?&#8221; But this is very easy information to obtain. The obvious attack is a social engineering one: pose as a market researcher and ask my SO (who is unaware that this question is a secret one) about TV viewing habits in the household.</p>

<p>So thinking up questions is hard. Here, multiply that level of difficulty by five.</p>

<p>Secondly, it generally requires some experience in security, in order to know what is guessable or knowable by others. For instance I know enough security to know about the social engineering attack mentioned previously. But would an average Joe know this? For each question you have to consider how you would mount an attack to determine the answer. In my opinion it is totally unreasonable to expect users of a system to have the expertise required to do this.</p>

<p>Thirdly, even a sufficiently savvy user is entirely unmotivated to do the right thing here anyway, because they have a goal that is entirely unrelated to authentication. The goal is to <em>use the website</em>, and any mistakes they make or shortcuts they take in selecting a secret Q&amp;A are not necessarily going to result in a security breach for weeks or months or years after. In short, this is the web equivalent of the Windows <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">Find Setup Wizard</a>, and a usability disaster.</p>

<h4>HOWNOTTO: Use Secret Questions</h4>

<p>Let me finally wrap up with a summary, presented as a list of things for you (Medicare) to do when they next redesign their website.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get professional security advice.</strong> I am just some random guy on the internet and I can see that your site security is broken in so many ways. Seriously, get help from someone who knows about this stuff. I think the lack of security experience was the source of the random-two-of-five-questions problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t use secret questions.</strong> As I hope I&#8217;ve demonstrated, there are too many ways to come unstuck. Find other ways of authenticating your users if they lose their password. How did you authenticate them in the first place?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the big two. But if you must use secret questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t let users choose them.</strong> You need to have an understanding of security in order to make secret questions secure, and most users won&#8217;t have this. Nor should they be expected to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Let users change them.</strong> The questions, that is. The answers leak out all the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use only as a backup to forgotten passwords.</strong> Why? Because they are <em>not as secure</em> as passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t let them be saved to AutoComplete data.</strong> Bit of a technical one.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s about it for now. Join me next time on Medicare Website Disasters when I show how they violate their own privacy policy. Until then, goodnight.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amongst my family I am rapidly acquiring a reputation as The Explainer of Internet Mindreading Tricks.</p>

<p>The <a href="/articles/2006/02/09/the-mindreader">last time</a> it was relatively simple. This time, not so much.</p>

<p><a href="http://digicc.com/fido">Try it yourself</a>, excuse the advertising, and then read on for my explanation.</p>

<p><span id="more-212"></span></p>

<p>So lets say we start with a two digit number where the digits are a and b.</p>

<p>The number is 10a + b. We jumble it up in the only way we can to give 10b + a.</p>

<p>Subtract them and we get 9a &#8211; 9b = 9 (a &#8211; b)</p>

<p>Try it with three digits a b and c</p>

<p>abc &#8211; acb : 100a &#8211; 100a + 10b &#8211; 10c + c &#8211; b = 9b &#8211; 9c = 9 (b &#8211; c)</p>

<p>This time there are a few more combinations:</p>

<p>abc &#8211; bca : 100a &#8211; 100b + 10b &#8211; 10c + c &#8211; a = 99a &#8211; 90b &#8211; 9c = 9 (11a &#8211; 10b &#8211; c)
abc &#8211; cab : 100a &#8211; 100c + 10b &#8211; 10a + c &#8211; b = 90a &#8211; 99c + 9b = 9 (10a &#8211; 11c + b)</p>

<p>In fact, this number is always divisible by 9. The reason is that the &#8220;a&#8221; term of the answer is always going to be equal to (some power of 10)a &#8211; (some other power of 10)a. In other words:</p>

<p>10<sup>x</sup>a &#8211; 10<sup>y</sup>a</p>

<p>for some x and y. If x > y then this equals:</p>

<p>10<sup>y</sup> ( 10<sup>x-y</sup>a &#8211; a )</p>

<p>which is</p>

<p>10<sup>y</sup> a (10<sup>x-y</sup> &#8211; 1)</p>

<p>And 10 to some power minus 1 is always divisible by 9 if you think about it.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ve got a number divisible by 9. If we type all but one of the digits of this number into the computer &#8211; can the computer work out the other digit (which it knows isn&#8217;t a zero)?</p>

<p>Well with two digits again, the number is going to be one of: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99.</p>

<p>But, if you give me one of the digits of those numbers I can always give you the other (non-zero) digit. Notice that the digits always add up to nine! So give me a 5, and I&#8217;ll give you 9 &#8211; 5 = 4 in return. Give me a 9 and I&#8217;ll give you another 9 in return (again because it won&#8217;t be a zero)</p>

<p>For three digits, we get the same sort of thing:</p>

<p>108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, &#8230;</p>

<p>With a three-digit multiple of 9, the digits always add up to 9 or 18. As it turns out this is a general property, namely the digits of a multiple of 9 always add up to a multiple of 9. It&#8217;s easy to disprove: pick a random number, multiply by 9, add the digits and see if it&#8217;s also a multiple of 9. If you want it, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/67061.html">nice proof</a> that I wish I had come up with.</p>

<p>So for the computer to get the missing digit, all it has to do is add up the digits you give it, and subtract the result from the nearest multiple of 9.</p>

<p>Bingo!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2006/09/13/ethics-of-puzzle-solving-techniques/">recent post on OddThinking</a> got me thinking oddly about puzzles, particularly their relevance to software engineering. Julian uses the example of some thinking which enabled him to solve a puzzle but which would not be appropriate for solving software engineering problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/09/13/1559207">This topic came up on slashdot recently</a>. The consensus seemed to be that the IT industry was moving more towards the use of puzzle solving as a recruitment technique, and that it was a good thing. As a commenter put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the ability to solve puzzles is tightly correlated with the skill set desired by IT. Because it takes an inquisitive and unrelenting mind to hit the hardest puzzles. If they like to do this for fun, surely they can do it well for a living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am in qualified agreement with this. Despite not being the world&#8217;s best puzzle solver I can see how the use of logic and imagination can be invaluable to software engineering. Not sure if I would generalise this beyond software engineering to &#8220;IT&#8221; though.</p>

<p>Solving puzzles is certainly a useful &mdash; and technology-neutral &mdash; screening technique for recruitment purposes. But it only goes so far.</p>

<h4>Backtracking</h4>

<p>There&#8217;s a technique which is available when solving puzzles that simply isn&#8217;t practical for most software development situations. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2005/05/21/puzzling-over-puzzles/">backtracking</a>. This is of course a technique where you make an informed choice amongst many options, and work through the consequences of this choice to either the solution of the problem/puzzle, or you encounter a conflict and you backtrack to the original decision point, having now established that your original choice was incorrect. Sudoku addicts are almost certainly masters of backtracking.</p>

<p>Backtracking is fine when solving puzzles, but it is rarely useful in solving software engineering problems. In all but the smallest of problems, you often can&#8217;t commit the resources if your choice turns out to be incorrect. The exception to this rule is the  prototype, but these have fallen out of favour. Instead, projects are managed for constant, incremental, improvements; this fundamentally conflicts with the technique of backtracking.</p>

<h4>Metagaming</h4>

<p>There are other techniques for solving puzzles where you step outside the stated rules of the puzzle. Or more specifically you look for constraints on the solution which are imposed by context or other factors. <a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2006/09/14/meta-gaming-and-hitori/">Julian&#8217;s clever optimisation of the Hitori puzzle</a> is a good example. This may or may not be called metagaming, depending on which definition you subscribe to.</p>

<p>In software development such techniques are often useless. For any normal puzzle, the stated rules are 100% complete, but for software, forget it. There are <em>always</em> other rules and constraints and other gotchas. Even if you come up with an elegant software solution to a given problem, you can often find it rejected for reasons that were not stated up-front. It doesn&#8217;t match the aesthetics of your team lead. It uses a technology that is politically unsound within the organisation. It uses too much RAM. It uses multiple inheritance. It&#8217;s too advanced for the other developers. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>There are almost certainly many other significant qualitative differences between recreational puzzles and real life software development problems. What are they? Answers below please. No backtracking.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a science fiction story I read as a kid, and I want to say that it&#8217;s Phillip K. Dick&#8217;s <cite>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</cite>, but that may not be right. In this story, or one like it, I can remember being amused and confused at the decadent characters in the story who, as adults, would take a drug that would instantly transport them back to relive some of the more pleasant experiences from their early childhood. The obvious name &#8220;Wayback&#8221; comes to mind.</p>

<p>At the time I read about Wayback, I couldn&#8217;t understand the appeal. <em>Why</em> would you want to revisit your childhood? It seemed pretty odd.</p>

<p>As an adult I now know the lure of the past all too well. (And no, I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="/articles/2004/12/08/why-bother">re-reading one&#8217;s previous blog posts</a>, though the principle is the same). The past can be quite addictive. We carry with us through life little souvenirs, which are very handy triggers to recall the past. Smells, music, clothes, movies, books; all are basically a more dilute form of Wayback. And using these to take the occasional stroll through the landscape of one&#8217;s childhood memories can be quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Of these popular culture artifacts, some can be digitised and preserved forever. Or at least until those who care about them die off. And as we all know, bits are a lot easier to store long-term than atoms. It seems that music and movies are already well catered for; it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to find some surprisingly obscure movies and music online (copyright notwithstanding, and I&#8217;ll get to that).</p>

<div class="aside"><p>I just found out that &#8220;artefact&#8221; is the British spelling of &#8220;artifact&#8221;. Wondering which of the two is the definitive Australian English, I went to the <a href="http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/">Macquarie Dictionary</a>, only to find out that it&#8217;s now subscription based. It never used to be, did it? Anyway, this is yet another example of a great resource paid for by the Australian public and now sold back to us. So I&#8217;m left with no choice but assuming that the British spelling is definitive, and therefore using the American form as a form of very weak protest. Take <em>that</em>, Macquarie!</p></div>

<p>Books are, somewhat ironically, far more transient than movies. It&#8217;s a lot harder to find an out-of-print book from the 1970s than a movie from the same period. I&#8217;m sure this has something to do with the sheer volume of printed material, as well as the relative difficulty of creating a digital archive of it. The problem is particularly acute for material that is not out of copyright, but predates the rise of the Internet.</p>

<p>Now I can apparently still buy a copy of <cite>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</cite>. But what are my chances of finding a copy of <cite>2000 A.D.</cite> where <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Judge%20Dredd">Judge Dredd</a> battles the League of Fatties? OK, so  it&#8217;s not exactly Voltaire, and maybe in 50 years time noone will care. But hey, I&#8217;d like to read it again. And I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/">probably not the only one</a>.</p>

<p>Copyright laws quite rightly stop us just scanning any old thing and putting it online. But what if the book is out of print? Surely the collective publishing industry could just look the other way? OK maybe not.</p>

<p>For clearly important works like, I dunno, <cite><a href="http://www.sweetjesusihatebilloreilly.com/FactorForKidsReview.html">The O&#8217;Reilly Factor For Kids</a></cite> we can look to the major libraries to keep a copy and in however-many years after the death of the copyright holder&#8217;s lawyer we can expect someone to dust it off and scan it for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>But at the lowbrow end of the literary scale I would argue that there is a very real chance that a significant proportion of printed material is just never going to survive to be made available online. Fifty years after the death of the Judge Dredd artists, are there going to be any <cite>2000 A.D.</cite> progs even left any more? If so, what condition will they be in? If we even wanted to digitise this material after so much time sitting in someone&#8217;s closet, what would be the result?</p>

<p>With the long tail effect, you can pretty much count on every published work being valuable to <em>someone</em>. Readers outnumber authors by a significant margin, so it&#8217;s a reasonable first assumption that <em>every</em> published work is worth saving. And we shouldn&#8217;t be relying on the libraries to save us (no disrespect intended). I say to hell with the copyright laws, if it&#8217;s out of print and is not likely to earn the author any more sales, then get it online pronto! Or at least scan it in and keep it in escrow.</p>

<p>When traditional journalism reaches its limits, the citizen journalists step in. By extension, when traditional libraries reach their limits, the citizen librarians step in.</p>

<p>A published work which is out of print and which may perish unless someone save it. Like a literary Steve Irwin. I&#8217;d like to see other people do the same. There must be lots of boxes hidden in closets all over the world, filled with rare gems. Or lots of obscure trash which assorted random people all over the world may appreciate. In other words: stuff that needs to be on the Internet.</p>

<p>Obviously there are other challenges besides the copyright laws, there are the technical challenges of getting the best quality scan, performing OCR, storage, etc. But it seems like a worthwhile challenge.</p>

<p>So to kick off, I&#8217;ll dig deep into the darkest corners of my library and find something that deserves to be preserved for posterity. I&#8217;ll have a go at preserving it myself and report back.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In general I find it a lot easier to put my data somewhere that I know I will be able to get it out again. This applies especially for web applications hosted by third-parties, where export facilities are a must before I&#8217;ll even look at it, but I believe it is generally a good practice.</p>

<p>Hence the motivation for a common interchange format for blog content. This is an escape hatch, if you will, for migration to an unspecified future blogging platform.</p>

<p>Admittedly my recent migration from Wordpress to Typo was pretty easy, so in that that particular instance the lack of a common content exchange format was not a problem. But it certainly is a problem in general. And the less time blog software authors spend on writing importers for all the other blogging engines around the place, the more time they will have to concentrate on features. That sounds like a good thing to me.</p>

<p>It turns out that a content interchange format can be created using some simple conventions over and extensions of the <a href="http://atompub.org/rfc4287.html">Atom syndication format</a>. I&#8217;ve written these up as a proposal for anyone and everyone to comment upon. Please read the ObDisclaimer at the start and let me know your comments.</p>

<p>Enjoy <a href="/offerings/atomexport">Content Export with Atom</a>.</p>
