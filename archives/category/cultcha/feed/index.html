			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it was good while it lasted, but I&#8217;ve just downloaded my last album from eMusic.</p>

<p>I was once quite <a href="/archives/2008/05/14/emusic/">enamoured</a> with this service, so what changed? </p>

<p>Well basically they changed their prices. And by that I mean they increased their prices. And by that I mean their prices went through the roof.</p>

<p>Up until this month you could download 75 tracks/month for US$20. Now, you&#8217;ll pay US$31 for those tracks.</p>

<p>Obviously this isn&#8217;t the first time that someone has hiked their prices by 50%, but that&#8217;s not really the point of this post. Instead it&#8217;s the other, extremely deceptive, change that went along with the overt price hike. Your monthly eMusic fee no longer allows you to purchase 75 tracks; instead you&#8217;ll get 75 &#8220;credits&#8221;. They want you think that a credit equates to a single track, but it quite obviously doesn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re purchasing by the album (and for many tracks you have to) then the number of credits required almost always exceeds the number of tracks.</p>

<p>For an admittedly extreme example, consider the epic post-rock album <cite>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven</cite> by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It has four 20 minute &mdash; mind-blowing and highly recommended &mdash; tracks. Before the pricing change, this was about 5% of the 75-track monthly quota. Now, downloading this album requires no fewer than <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/godspeed-you-black-emperor-Lift-Your-Skinny-Fists-Like-Antennas-to-Heaven-MP3-Download/10909937.html">24 credits</a>, which is about a third of quota, and about a 600% increase. None of the tracks can be downloaded individually any more.</p>

<p>So you might think, regardless of the increase, that still works out at just over US$10 for an album, which sounds very fair. But this just begs the question: why don&#8217;t they just charge the US$10/album and be done with it?</p>

<p>The subscription plan and the &#8220;credits&#8221; and all that nonsense is just annoying, and that&#8217;s the main reason why I&#8217;m leaving. I can pay US$10/album at <a href="/archives/2007/10/09/easier-than-stealing/">Amazon</a> and I don&#8217;t have to worry about my monthly quota, rollovers, unused credits, the terrible website, the mysteriously &#8220;unavailable&#8221; albums or individual tracks, and all of the other specific problems with the eMusic service.</p>

<p>I admit I had a good ride. And maybe something had to change at eMusic anyway. The whole premise of charging per track is fraught with problems. The economics of this is predicated on 4 min radio-friendly pop songs, and just doesn&#8217;t work out for other types of music.</p>

<p>What I <em>really</em> want is to pay a fixed amount for a fixed <em>duration</em> of music. I&#8217;d easily pay US$1 per 10 minutes of music. It seems like absolutely the fairest and simplest way of doing doing things, and the way that eMusic could have changed while still keeping my business.</p>

<p>Failing that I&#8217;ll just pay per album. But not at eMusic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, everyone&#8217;s a photographer. There can be no doubt that the advent of the digital camera has provided vast numbers with the means to explore their creativity through photography. As such there is a vast and growing industry just to support the great unwashed in their quest to take better photographs, or at least to advise what camera to buy.</p>

<p>So there is absolutely <em>no need</em> for anyone else to be dispensing photographic advice. But here I go anyway!</p>

<p>My unique angle, such as it is, is that I recently had an &#8230; unscheduled equipment upgrade. Otherwise known as a burglary. This meant starting afresh with all-new shiny toys, courtesy of the insurance company.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of articles in which I <del>gloat</del> review some photographic kit and provide some hopefully helpful advice along the way.</p>

<p>But firstly let me disclaim that I have no photographic credentials to speak of. You probably know more about photography than I do. But then again maybe you don&#8217;t. Maybe you can view my shots (below) and decide for yourself.</p>

<p><span id="more-3215"></span></p>

<h4>The Big Question</h4>

<p>For a few years now the most common photographic equipment dillema has been: DSLR or not. Ever since a few years ago when the Canon EOS 300D arrived on the scene at an affordable price, people like myself have been constantly wondering whether to go for great quality photographs with the big and heavy DSLR, or for lower quality but enjoy convenience of the small and light point-n-shoot.</p>

<p>My old camera equipment was burgled shortly before we took off on the <a href="/archives/2008/4/10/the-next-plane-out-of-sydney">previously-mentioned</a> vacation to Thaliand. Hence I needed to find a replacement camera in a hurry. I asked my friend Peter, who dispensed some excellent advice. He told me that although he owned a very capable DSLR, the camera he ended up using 95% of the time was his venerable Panasonic Lumix. The convenience of the small camera means that it is simply <em>available</em> to take shots, when the DSLR is sleeping soundly in its camera bag (or where-ever).</p>

<p>Although recently DSLRs have become cheaper and lighter, so too the point-n-shoots have become more capable. I think that the quality and performance gap between a point-n-shoot and a DSLR is partly due to hard physical limits. For example, it seems to be very hard to make a small, light, fast lens. Until this obstacle is overcome, there will continue to be a huge gap between DSLRs and compacts in terms of size and performance. However in the meantime I take the view that DSLRs and (quality) point-n-shoots are complementary.</p>

<h4>The Serious Compacts Arrive</h4>

<p>Camera makers are realising this too, and recently there has emerged a segment of the camera market devoted to what I <a href="http://www.seriouscompacts.com/">and others</a> call serious compacts.</p>

<p>You can generally tell a serious compact from the rest by the presence of RAW image capture. And although it&#8217;s not a particularly must-have feature (IMHO anyway), generally such cameras have other worthwhile features such as more flexible controls, a flash hotshoe, better sensors, and faster performance.</p>

<p>Up until a few years ago the sensor pixel count was a handy metric to assess the quality of the camera, but now the number is almost irrelevant; almost all cameras have adequate pixels for most purposes, and so the megapixel count is generally unimportant.</p>

<p>However there is a single number which, in my experience, <em>does</em> provide a useful guage of the quality of a compact camera: the maximum lens aperture (the lower the number, the better, by the way). And this guideline certainly holds for the serious compacts, most of which have very good lenses, given their size.</p>

<p>In short, this market segment has attracted a lot of attention lately, and there are some terrific cameras coming out.</p>

<h4>Ricoh GX100: Lens</h4>

<p>This is the compact camera I chose: a <a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/caplio/gx100/">Ricoh GX100</a>. Of course it is now obsolete, as the <a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gx/gx200/">GX200</a> has now come out, and is a mild improvement on its predecessor.</p>

<p>To my mind the best thing about the GX100 (which it shares with the GX200) is the lens. It is a zoom, with a maximum aperture of f/2.5 at its widest, down to f/4.4 when zoomed in (72mm equivalent). The wide aperture allows lots of light in, which means you don&#8217;t need to use the flash, and it also that great Bokeh effect where the background is blurred to emphasise the subject.</p>

<p><div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2437788347' is invalid.</p></div></p>

<p>Also handy is the fact that it can zoom <em>out</em>, to a equivalent of 24mm. This is fantastic for indoor shots, or other relatively confined spaces where you often just can&#8217;t get far enough away to get everything in frame. Real-estate agents, this is your camera!</p>

<p>Lastly, the lens will focus objects that are as close as 1cm away. This makes it ideal for close-ups.</p>

<p><div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2464194282' is invalid.</p></div></p>

<p>In a lot of ways, the GX100 is more flexible than my DSLR.</p>

<h4>Ricoh GX100: Features</h4>

<p>The Ricoh has many other redeeming features besides the lens. It also shoots RAW images, although these do take about 3&ndash;4 seconds to write to the memory card, so I use this feature sparingly.</p>

<p>It supports most of the usual shooting modes (portrait, macro, sports, etc) that you find on most cameras but also allows for program mode and aperture-priority. The auto-focus feature is good, but manual focus is also possible, and sometimes necessary.</p>

<p>There is an electronic (that is to say, little LCD screen) viewfinder available as an optional attachment. I generally don&#8217;t use it because I always forget to take it with me!</p>

<p>There is a high-ISO mode which increases the sensitivity of the camera and allows low-light shots without a flash. However the increase in noise is noticable above about ISO 400, so this feature is of limited benefit. I think if there was one thing that I would change about the GX100 it would be to reduce sensor noise at high ISO settings.</p>

<h4>Gallery</h4>

<p>Here are some shots taken with the GX100. Most have had some light editing. More on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arankine/">flickr</a>.</p>

<p><div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2616353675' is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2437788501' is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2438609730' is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2437788023' is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="flickrTag_error"><p>Flickr Tag Error: The mode '2437787865' is invalid.</p></div></p>

<h4>Coming Up</h4>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m very happy with the GX100; it takes great pictures and is a great complement to a DSLR. Next article I&#8217;m going to talk about my DSLR and how much it confuses me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you know, I&#8217;m a fan of the DRM free music. In fact it seems that I&#8217;ve blogged about it each time I&#8217;ve discovered a new website that sells the stuff. And the latest discovery is <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">emusic</a>. They have hits and some misses.</p>

<p><span id="more-2926"></span></p>

<h4>Hits</h4>

<p>The subscription model is fantastic. It&#8217;s great to be able to just pick a plan to match the rate at which you discover new music, or get sick of music in your existing collection. The subscription promotes a totally different mindset for purchasing music, one that is more optimistic and more willing to experiment. This is a good thing for all concerned.</p>

<p>Also the prices are quite reasonable. Better than reasonable really; $10 for 30 songs per month.</p>

<p>Unlike Amazon&#8217;s store, emusic is actually available to Australians, and presumably other non-USians as well. Hooray! In the past I&#8217;ve noticed some tracks on emusic have been not available &#8220;in my region&#8221;, but now that I&#8217;ve gone looking for them I can&#8217;t find any. Either way, it&#8217;s pretty rare.</p>

<p>The music selection is really good, and getting better. I&#8217;ve found that they have a lot of quite obscure titles and artists. In general Amazon might be better for the older back catalogue, and the more mainstream artists, but between the two there is more than enough keep you amused.</p>

<p>In writing this article, I just noticed that Radiohead is finally available through emusic. Just the one album, <cite>In Rainbows</cite>, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>If you don&#8217;t have <cite>In Rainbows</cite>, please just trust me and get it immediately. I acknowledge that you (<a href="/archives/2006/6/6/creative-uncommon">still</a>) don&#8217;t have any reason to trust my music recommendations.</p></div>

<p>The tracks are mostly ~160Kbps MP3s, encoded with LAME 3.96. I haven&#8217;t noticed any quality problems, but then again I haven&#8217;t heard them against the originals in a <a href="/archives/2007/9/20/getting-double-blind">double-blind</a> test, so take that statement for what it&#8217;s worth.</p>

<p>As well as music they now have a pretty decent collection of DRM-free audiobooks. (Just for the record, I refuse to use Audible on account of their DRM).</p>

<p>The monthly rate of $10 for 1 book is charged in addition to any music plan you might have, and yet it&#8217;s still the cheapest way to get audiobooks that I know of.</p>

<h4>Misses</h4>

<p>They don&#8217;t always score hits though. For one, the website is absolutely awful. I mean really awful. It&#8217;s difficult to navigate, and it&#8217;s hideously ugly. Not a good combination. Still, you can get used to it and find the music you&#8217;re after and use it to select either individual songs to download or entire albums.</p>

<p>But the frustration really starts when you&#8217;ve got 9 songs left in your monthly quota and you want to download a 10 song album. You might think that it would just send you the first 9 and queue the remaining song until the start of the next billing cycle. Nope! Instead, you have to click to download each of the 9 songs individually and then remember to get the last one next month. DO NOT WANT!</p>

<p>To download the music there is a download helper application, but it&#8217;s a klunky PowerPC application and won&#8217;t automatically add tunes to iTunes. (Or maybe I&#8217;m missing something?)</p>

<p>So after you&#8217;ve downloaded the songs and manually added them to iTunes, you&#8217;ll be underwhelmed by the lack of album art. Then, because like me you&#8217;re quite anal-retentive about metadata, you&#8217;ll go straight off to somewhere like Amazon or Discogs to bring the new tracks up to your exacting standards.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>One of the not-widely acknowledged features of Nine Inch Nails&#8217; recent forays into online distribution is the impeccable quality of their metadata and accompanying collateral. Both of the recent albums came with different art for each of the tracks already embedded. That&#8217;s the way you do online distribution right&#8230;</p></div>

<p>And speaking of metadata, there&#8217;s very little application of it on the website. This isn&#8217;t a gripe so much as a missing feature. They know what music everyone has downloaded, surely there are some basic correlations and recommendations to be made? They have made a token effort here but frankly they Could Try Harder.</p>

<p>I wonder why they don&#8217;t just outsource the community aspect of their site to someone like last.fm? Oh yeah, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/cbs_buys_lastfm.php">now I remember</a>.</p>

<p>Despite these problems you certainly could do worse (like buying from <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/05/06/the-day-the-music-died">MSN Music</a>, oops!) so overall recommended. The market is still new, more players are needed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herewith, some comments apropos of the Macworld 08 Keynote, specifically Randy Newman&#8217;s performance at the end.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Keynote as a whole seems to have moved from slick-but-reality-distorted marketing into the realms of straight-out entertainment. Apple are simply leading the pack, and I expect Microsoft and others to follow (e.g. Bill Gates&#8217;s CES keynote). At the end of the Keynote, Randy Newman sang a couple of songs and rambled (fairly incoherently I thought). Part of the monologue was related to Apple as he said that &#8220;this company&#8221; wasn&#8217;t like the others; although it was sufficiently vague that he could have been talking about Pixar instead. And aside from this one mention, Newman could have been playing a set on a late night chat show or something.</p>

<p>The convergence of entertainment with marketing is taken to an extreme in <a href="http://www.jonarmstrong.com/">Jon Armstrong</a>&#8217;s excellent and hilarious novel <cite>Grey</cite> (available for free on audio podcast from his site). Without giving away too much, in the world of <cite>Grey</cite>, corporate marketing includes &#8220;publicity dates&#8221; between members of the respective CEOs families, the resulting courtship is eagerly devoured by a gossip-hungry public, and actual information about the products or the company is completely ignored. In a similar vein, future MacWorld Keynotes could easily include dance routines from Steve Jobs&#8217; offspring. OK maybe not, but you have to wonder where it will end.</p>

<p>My second point is that the flavour of entertainment on display at the Macworld 08 show was particularly inappropriate I thought. The message came through pretty loud and clear: Randy Newman doesn&#8217;t like the Bush administration. The song <cite>A few words in defense of our country</cite> <a href="http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/a-few-words">makes the case</a> that the current US government is bad, but not as bad as it could have been, in comparison to the Roman Caesars for example (setting the bar rather low I would have thought).</p>

<p>Criticism of the Bush administration is something I obviously <a href="/archives/2006/10/19/my-list">have a lot of time for</a>. But is it suitable for a consumer product launch?</p>

<p>To those <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/01/keynote_roundup">apparently many</a> people at the launch who were pleased with Newman&#8217;s performance; please ask yourself how you would have felt if the entertainment had taken a position contrary to your own. Mark Nottingham <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/06/30/JavaOne">described</a> this exact situation a few years back. I have been in a similar situation, albeit on a smaller scale; prior to the Iraq invasion I was at a business meeting where one of the attendees made his clear pro-Bush views known, much to my discomfort.</p>

<p>Mix politics with business and you take a risk with a relatively small upside but a big downside. If your politics match mine, we are no more likely to do business together than before we knew each other&#8217;s positions. But if our politics disagree, this difference becomes a barrier that we each have to overcome in order to do business together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not arguing for censorship or anything. I&#8217;m just saying that the separation of politics and business is crucial for the success of both.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Broadcast radio is changing. It&#8217;s going digital, and with this change broadcasters are likely to start embedding watermarks in the audio stream (if they haven&#8217;t already). Podcasters, and other internet music publishers are <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080116-why-watermarking-will-never-replace-drm.html">likely to do the same</a>. Watermarks are inaudible markers that uniquely identify the broadcaster, and are also the key enabling technology of a great new business venture that I&#8217;ve just thought of, and will now share with you, in the hope that <em>someone</em>, if not me, implements it.</p>

<p>The elevator pitch: music insurance. Insurance against hearing music that you hate.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you wake up one day with a revelation. &#8220;I would,&#8221; you think to yourself, &#8220;pay good money to never have to hear Meat Loaf&#8217;s <cite>Paradise By The Dashboard Light</cite> <em>ever again</em>. I would pay until the end of time, should it hurry up and arrive.&#8221; Or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Pick whatever example you want here: maybe the <cite>Crazy Frog</cite> song might be your choice instead? Or Whitney Houston&#8217;s <cite>I Will Always Love You</cite>? I-I-I-I-I-I-eee-I-I-eee-I-I don&#8217;t wont to go on, I&#8217;m sure everyone has at least one song that is disliked to the point of justifying financial outlay. (For me it would be the majority of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock">AOR</a> canon, which could get expensive, but I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.)</p>

<p>So you take out insurance against accidentally hearing this song, whatever it might be. Like most insurance policies you pay a premium, and when you hear one of the covered songs, you make a claim and receive some financial compensation to ease the pain. All you have to do is prove that the music was broadcasted publicly and you couldn&#8217;t escape it. This guards against fraudulent claims, and is where technology comes in.</p>

<p>We need to make two simplifying assumptions. Firstly we require the music to be broadcast by a radio station or similar public broadcaster, who are motivated to watermark their broadcasts in the interest of asserting their license to do so. This precludes the private playing of insured music; in other words, you&#8217;re not allowed to play Celine Dion CDs <em>to yourself</em> and claim on them.</p>

<p>Secondly we require the insured to be in a public place, or specifically nominated private places, for the claim to be valid. This might be at work, at a pub, restaurant, or wherever you have no control over what radio station is played. This precludes you claiming against family members who play music too loud, but I&#8217;m sorry no insurer is going to go anywhere near that sort of dispute.</p>

<p>When you sign up for the policy you will download a small application to install on your mobile phone. When you hear an offensive song, you whip out your phone and start the application. This records a sample of the music, the date and time, and the place (either manually entered or from the GPS receiver). This information is transmitted (via internet, SMS, or whatever) to the insurer&#8217;s servers. These servers will automatically extract the music sample, match it against the sender&#8217;s insured songs, verify its authenticity using the watermark and location data. The watermark is verified against a known list of broadcasters, and the location data against a set of covered locations. If after this, the claim is determined to be valid, the insured amount would be paid.</p>

<p>Of course there is still a potential for fraudulent claims, but &mdash; without meaning to oversimplify the actuarial art &mdash; this can be countered by conventional risk management techniques. Claiming against <cite>Achy Breaky Heart</cite> when you&#8217;re <em>at</em> a Billy Ray Cyrus concert is obviously fraudulent, for example. And as with all insurance policies, the premiums and claim amounts can be adjusted in relation to specific risk factors, including the potential for fraud in a given situation. I am not an actuary, but feel free to chime in if you are (or can impersonate one on the internet).</p>

<p>Now I know it&#8217;s a great idea, but if you make millions from selling musical insurance policies, I don&#8217;t even want a cut. I just want you to cover me. Come on in and cover me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon recently opened their <a href="http://amazonmp3.com">MP3 store</a> (in &#8220;beta&#8221; of course). It is awesome.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I certainly didn&#8217;t see it coming. Previous Amazon efforts with downloaded content were pretty lame, and I had no idea that they were going to come back with an offering that was as good as this.</p>

<p>Although I am a <a href="/archives/2006/11/5/its-bleeping-good">very happy bleep.com customer</a>, their selection of music is limited to the Warp label plus a couple of degrees of separation. So I&#8217;ve been looking around at other DRM-free music stores, but few have excited me enough to become customers.</p>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s catalogue of music is quite large and hopefully getting larger. Most importantly, they have an extensive back-catalogue into which I have been delving in my quest to <a href="/archives/2004/10/5/too-legit-to-quit">go legit</a>, and to reclaim old legitimately-purchased albums that have got lost along the way. The purchase and download process is very easy and efficient.</p>

<p>I can also get individual songs from those long-lost albums. Somehow though I managed to turn on the infamous one-click purchase, so rather than bundling up a bunch of individual tracks and purchasing them en masse, Amazon conducts a separate transaction for each one. But no matter.</p>

<p>So if you have a US credit card, do yourself a favour and check it out. This, plus the new Radiohead release, make me think we&#8217;ve finally reached the point where purchasing legitimate DRM-free music is easier than stealing it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology people have an understandable tendancy to be a bit disdainful of printed material. We argue that bits are where the real value lies, and not in the atoms. Although books are seen as valuable and portable offline representations, they are mere projections into the physical world of the real asset, which is digital and intangible.</p>

<p>At least, that&#8217;s how I sometimes think.</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t know whether it is because my possibly skewed perception has been brought back to reality, or that there is a growing trend towards high-quality niche book publishing, but I have really been struck lately by some examples of the printed medium. I want to share some of these with you. And exercise my <a href="http://www.canon.com.au/products/scanners/scanners_low_medium_volume/canoscan600f.aspx">new scanner</a>.</p>

<p><span id="more-1551"></span></p>

<p>Obviously it&#8217;s fairly difficult to convey some of the beauty of these books over the web. Hence each of the scanned images is enlarged from their actual size. I hope this gives some impression of the quality of the printed page.</p>

<h4><cite><a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a></cite></h4>

<p>Where better to start than this self-published book by Edward Tufte. I haven&#8217;t finished reaading it yet, so just want to focus for now on the book as a physical artifact. It&#8217;s just a beautiful book, an embodiment of the theme of effective and aesthetic commnication. The detail and the care that has gone into the production of the book is entirely evident.</p>

<p>Here, Tufte is explaining through illustration the value of his &#8220;sparkline&#8221; mini-graphs:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/03/beautiful-evidence.jpg" alt="Extract from Tufte&#039;s &#039;Beautiful Evidence&#039;" title="beautiful-evidence" width="709" height="303" class="size-full wp-image-3751" /></p>

<p>Obviously these sparklines are something of a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000742.html">money-shot from Tufte&#8217;s book</a> but I am equally impressed by the typography. Each paragraph is left-justified but neither excessively ragged on the right side, nor excessively hyphenated.</p>

<p>Similarly all of the pages are laid out with very thoughtfully. Each of the illustrations is local to the explanatory text, such that you never find yourself flipping back and forth to refer to illustrations while reading text (a pet hate of mine).</p>

<p>Lastly the quality of the paper stock and binding is first rate. And it should be; check out Tufte&#8217;s <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000262&amp;topic_id=1">chronicle of the production process</a>. Everything about this book screams quality and this reinforces the message being conveyed.</p>

<h4><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Novelty_Library">Acme Novelty Library 16</a></cite></h4>

<p>I picked this extract from Chris Ware&#8217;s amazing comic book series as a successor to the Tufte book because the similarities are quite striking. Here in this fairly random extract from his apartment story &mdash; unrelated, and almost an afterthought to the main Rusty Brown story &mdash; he tells a funny and moving story using a mostly text-free but dense and diagrammatic style that I&#8217;m sure Tufte would approve of. It&#8217;s almost like a flowchart.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/03/acme-novelty-library.jpg" alt="Extract from Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Library 16" title="acme-novelty-library" width="600" height="298" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3707" /></p>

<p>There is quite intricate detail here, amidst a very geometric and stark style. Needless to say the web would not be able to do this justice.</p>

<p>Comics of my youth were printed so cheaply that the transition from paper to screen is likely to lose very little detail and nuance (if it can be said that <cite>2000AD</cite> had much nuance in the first place!). Although it can be argued that this low-quality printing was part of the charm of comics, I for one am glad that artists of Ware&#8217;s calibre are now able to be appreciated on a new level.</p>

<h4><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McSweeney%27s_Quarterly_Concern">McSweeney&#8217;s Quarterly Concern 16</a></cite></h4>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to adequately convey the content of an issue of the Quarterly Concern. What follows is is the open passage from Robert Coover&#8217;s <cite>Heart Suit</cite>, a story printed on a deck of slightly oversized playing cards.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/03/heart-suit.jpg" alt="Extract from Robert Coover&#039;s Heart Suit" title="heart-suit" width="800" height="416" class="size-full wp-image-3708" /></p>

<p>On the back of the cards is a design which is subtly tailored to the content of the story on the reverse site. It&#8217;s very cleverly done.</p>

<p>This is a publication where the physical object is not just a conveyance for content. It is in fact essential, a part of the literary work as a whole. Although I&#8217;m not quite sure why there is a comb included with this edition.</p>

<h4>Victims of Posterity?</h4>

<p>So a <a href="/articles/2006/9/12/citizen-librarian">while back</a> I postulated that we should be doing our bit for posterity by scanning printed works that are right out at the far end of the long tail. I haven&#8217;t changed my mind on this; but it is pretty obvious that not everything can be adequately captured for the long term. I don&#8217;t have a good solution to this problem. In the meantime I, for one, will try to appreciate atoms more than I have in the past.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some brief thoughts on <cite>The God Delusion</cite>, Richard Dawkins&#8217; latest book.</p>

<p>I was initially reluctant to read <cite>The God Delusion</cite>, on the assumption that it was going to tell me a lot of things I already know, and reinforce views I already have. And I assumed that it was just going to make me cross. Upon reading it, and re-reading it, I do commend this book to other atheists, wavering atheists, and especially to agnostics. And of course open-minded religious people. For me the surprises were:</p>

<ul>
<li>A systematic cataloguing of the dubious moral lessons contained in the bible;</li>
<li>A detailed demolition of the idea that science and religion occupy separate &#8220;magesteria&#8221;,  where each is entirely independent of the other;</li>
<li>Some interesting observations on the extent to which supposedly secular societies can bend over backwards to accommodate religious belief;</li>
<li>A fascinating chapter on the possible Darwinian explanations for the origins of religious belief as a near-universal human trait;</li>
<li>Popularising the term &#8220;American Taliban&#8221; to refer to fundamentalist Christians in the US;</li>
<li>Meditations on the extent to which our perceptions are drastically limited by our evolutionary legacy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter point culminates in a particularly inspiring passage at the end of the book. Dawkins channels Sagan in looking towards science to inspire us through new perceptions of the world.</p>

<p>Although there is plenty in the book that is contrary to established religion, Dawkins spends considerable time on the power of science to inspire and to &#8220;raise consciousness&#8221; (as he puts it). So it&#8217;s not all bashing the bible-bashers. But when doing so he is quite forthright and provocative. The title itself says it all, although I get the feeling he would have preferred &#8220;The God Hypothesis&#8221; as a title because that phrase occurs far more commonly in the book. Still he devotes some time to explaining his tactics, namely to avoid a confrontative debate with his opponents.</p>

<p>As evidenced by a recent <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,303,Reading-of-The-God-Delusion-in-Lynchburg-VA,Richard-Dawkins--C-SPAN2">appearance at a Lynchburg, VA university</a>, he is clearly not an aggressive man. He listens thoughtfully and responds succinctly and clearly. <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/images/LaurieTaylorNewHumanist.pdf">This article</a> in the New Humanist discusses Dawkins&#8217; tactics further with reference to that incident, and includes a highly telling response to one question: &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m rambling on about tactics because some of the reaction to the book has tried to paint the picture of a rising new force of &#8220;militant atheism&#8221;, lead by Dawkins and others. For example, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/02/news/letter.php">Richard Bernstein in the IHT</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1983820,00.html#article_continue">Tobias Jones in the Guardian</a>. These two use the term &#8220;militant atheism&#8221; and it is entirely unjustified. Dawkins strikes pre-emptively in the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I might retort that such hostility as I or other atheists occasionally voice towards religion is limited to words. I am not going to bomb anybody, behead them, stone them, burn them at the stake, crucify them, or fly planes into their skyscrapers, just because of a theological disagreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bar is set quite high for militancy.</p>

<p>Bernstein&#8217;s article exposes a bit of a blind spot with regards to religious militancy, claiming that unlike Islam, &#8220;Christian fundamentalism [engages] in no violence or threats.&#8221; Which of course makes me wonder if he&#8217;s even read the book he&#8217;s talking about. Dawkins writes at length about the threats he has personally received, and about the terrorists who kill doctors in the name of Christianity, and other modern-day examples. And what about George W. Bush&#8217;s claim that God told him to invade Iraq? Does that not count as Christian fundamentalism also?</p>

<p>Dawkins does not demand any action of his readers, except to help raise consciousness. He explicitly draws his tactics from the feminist movements who encouraged us to think about language and how it reinforces an undesirable mindset. He also makes parallels to the gay pride movement, trying to bring atheists out of the closet. Neither of these can be claimed to be militant by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>So please raise your consciousness, come out of the closet, and read <cite>The God Delusion</cite>. Or I&#8217;ll kill you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The features I want out of an online music store are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No DRM. At all. Seriously.</li>
<li>MP3 encoded at a high bitrate (diskspace is cheap).</li>
<li>Optional lossless encoding.</li>
<li>Reasonable prices.</li>
<li>Must be legit (rules out allofmp3 for example).</li>
<li>Decent website with online previews.</li>
<li>Appropriate embedded meta-data.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am happy to say that although it is not perfect, <a href="http://www.bleep.com/">Bleep</a> is pretty close to satisfying every item on my list. (hat tip: <a href="http://www.uninnovate.com/2006/10/11/bleepcom-nearly-unknown-music-store-beats-itunes-for-uk-music-award/">Uninnovate</a>)</p>

<p>Bleep is a spin-off of the hugely influential electronic music label <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_Records">Warp Records</a>. Hence the catalogue is heavy with Warp and similar electronic artists. Not the sort of thing you&#8217;re likely to hear on commercial radio.</p>

<p>The website is probably the least appealing thing about Bleep. It looks pretty &mdash; thanks to <a href="http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/">TDR</a> design &mdash; but it&#8217;s a usability nightmare. No scroll bars, fixed layout, weird coverart-based navigation. However it is quite searchable and there are online previews of all songs in their entirety (but served up in 30 second chunks). Also, you can embed colour-coordinated previews in your own site, like this:</p>

<iframe name="bleepPlayer" id="bleepPlayer" width="341" height="141" src="http://www.bleep.com/player/?/WARP128/3791/maxiplus/FFFFFF/575757/993300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>That&#8217;s a track from Autechre&#8217;s <cite>Confield</cite>, specifically chosen because 30 seconds is probably all you&#8217;re going be able to listen to. (That album is particularly impenetrable to mere mortals, although I am a big fan of some of their other stuff.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to see Bleep provide some user reviews, artist background info, and notable previous works. Preferably outsourced to another site that specialises in this stuff.</p>

<p>On the plus side, all tracks are available as MP3 encoded in LAME using the canonical <code>--alt-preset standard</code> option. Some are also available with <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a> encoding, which is a nice touch. (Unfortunately FLAC doesn&#8217;t seem to be playable in iTunes yet.)</p>

<p>MP3 encoded albums are all US$9.95 from what I can see. FLAC encoding costs a little more. Individual tracks are also available, but I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;d bother.</p>

<p>In the name of research I bought an album and EP. The purchase experience was quite pleasant although after concluding the paypal-based payment the download did not start automatically as promised. No worries though, there&#8217;s a downloads page where you can download all the songs you have paid for but not received yet.</p>

<p>I would like the ability to re-download purchases but Bleep does not seem to allow this. No matter, just burn a CD and keep it with all the other <a href="/articles/2005/10/08/a-cd-see">receipts</a>.</p>

<p>The download is delivered as a big honkin&#8217; zip file. You unzip, import to iTunes, sync to your iPod, and play happily ever after.</p>

<p>This is how music should be sold online. Recommended.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a science fiction story I read as a kid, and I want to say that it&#8217;s Phillip K. Dick&#8217;s <cite>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</cite>, but that may not be right. In this story, or one like it, I can remember being amused and confused at the decadent characters in the story who, as adults, would take a drug that would instantly transport them back to relive some of the more pleasant experiences from their early childhood. The obvious name &#8220;Wayback&#8221; comes to mind.</p>

<p>At the time I read about Wayback, I couldn&#8217;t understand the appeal. <em>Why</em> would you want to revisit your childhood? It seemed pretty odd.</p>

<p>As an adult I now know the lure of the past all too well. (And no, I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="/articles/2004/12/08/why-bother">re-reading one&#8217;s previous blog posts</a>, though the principle is the same). The past can be quite addictive. We carry with us through life little souvenirs, which are very handy triggers to recall the past. Smells, music, clothes, movies, books; all are basically a more dilute form of Wayback. And using these to take the occasional stroll through the landscape of one&#8217;s childhood memories can be quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Of these popular culture artifacts, some can be digitised and preserved forever. Or at least until those who care about them die off. And as we all know, bits are a lot easier to store long-term than atoms. It seems that music and movies are already well catered for; it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to find some surprisingly obscure movies and music online (copyright notwithstanding, and I&#8217;ll get to that).</p>

<div class="aside"><p>I just found out that &#8220;artefact&#8221; is the British spelling of &#8220;artifact&#8221;. Wondering which of the two is the definitive Australian English, I went to the <a href="http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/">Macquarie Dictionary</a>, only to find out that it&#8217;s now subscription based. It never used to be, did it? Anyway, this is yet another example of a great resource paid for by the Australian public and now sold back to us. So I&#8217;m left with no choice but assuming that the British spelling is definitive, and therefore using the American form as a form of very weak protest. Take <em>that</em>, Macquarie!</p></div>

<p>Books are, somewhat ironically, far more transient than movies. It&#8217;s a lot harder to find an out-of-print book from the 1970s than a movie from the same period. I&#8217;m sure this has something to do with the sheer volume of printed material, as well as the relative difficulty of creating a digital archive of it. The problem is particularly acute for material that is not out of copyright, but predates the rise of the Internet.</p>

<p>Now I can apparently still buy a copy of <cite>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</cite>. But what are my chances of finding a copy of <cite>2000 A.D.</cite> where <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Judge%20Dredd">Judge Dredd</a> battles the League of Fatties? OK, so  it&#8217;s not exactly Voltaire, and maybe in 50 years time noone will care. But hey, I&#8217;d like to read it again. And I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/">probably not the only one</a>.</p>

<p>Copyright laws quite rightly stop us just scanning any old thing and putting it online. But what if the book is out of print? Surely the collective publishing industry could just look the other way? OK maybe not.</p>

<p>For clearly important works like, I dunno, <cite><a href="http://www.sweetjesusihatebilloreilly.com/FactorForKidsReview.html">The O&#8217;Reilly Factor For Kids</a></cite> we can look to the major libraries to keep a copy and in however-many years after the death of the copyright holder&#8217;s lawyer we can expect someone to dust it off and scan it for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>But at the lowbrow end of the literary scale I would argue that there is a very real chance that a significant proportion of printed material is just never going to survive to be made available online. Fifty years after the death of the Judge Dredd artists, are there going to be any <cite>2000 A.D.</cite> progs even left any more? If so, what condition will they be in? If we even wanted to digitise this material after so much time sitting in someone&#8217;s closet, what would be the result?</p>

<p>With the long tail effect, you can pretty much count on every published work being valuable to <em>someone</em>. Readers outnumber authors by a significant margin, so it&#8217;s a reasonable first assumption that <em>every</em> published work is worth saving. And we shouldn&#8217;t be relying on the libraries to save us (no disrespect intended). I say to hell with the copyright laws, if it&#8217;s out of print and is not likely to earn the author any more sales, then get it online pronto! Or at least scan it in and keep it in escrow.</p>

<p>When traditional journalism reaches its limits, the citizen journalists step in. By extension, when traditional libraries reach their limits, the citizen librarians step in.</p>

<p>A published work which is out of print and which may perish unless someone save it. Like a literary Steve Irwin. I&#8217;d like to see other people do the same. There must be lots of boxes hidden in closets all over the world, filled with rare gems. Or lots of obscure trash which assorted random people all over the world may appreciate. In other words: stuff that needs to be on the Internet.</p>

<p>Obviously there are other challenges besides the copyright laws, there are the technical challenges of getting the best quality scan, performing OCR, storage, etc. But it seems like a worthwhile challenge.</p>

<p>So to kick off, I&#8217;ll dig deep into the darkest corners of my library and find something that deserves to be preserved for posterity. I&#8217;ll have a go at preserving it myself and report back.</p>
