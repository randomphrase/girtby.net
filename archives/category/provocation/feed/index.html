			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it was good while it lasted, but I&#8217;ve just downloaded my last album from eMusic.</p>

<p>I was once quite <a href="/archives/2008/05/14/emusic/">enamoured</a> with this service, so what changed? </p>

<p>Well basically they changed their prices. And by that I mean they increased their prices. And by that I mean their prices went through the roof.</p>

<p>Up until this month you could download 75 tracks/month for US$20. Now, you&#8217;ll pay US$31 for those tracks.</p>

<p>Obviously this isn&#8217;t the first time that someone has hiked their prices by 50%, but that&#8217;s not really the point of this post. Instead it&#8217;s the other, extremely deceptive, change that went along with the overt price hike. Your monthly eMusic fee no longer allows you to purchase 75 tracks; instead you&#8217;ll get 75 &#8220;credits&#8221;. They want you think that a credit equates to a single track, but it quite obviously doesn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re purchasing by the album (and for many tracks you have to) then the number of credits required almost always exceeds the number of tracks.</p>

<p>For an admittedly extreme example, consider the epic post-rock album <cite>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven</cite> by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It has four 20 minute &mdash; mind-blowing and highly recommended &mdash; tracks. Before the pricing change, this was about 5% of the 75-track monthly quota. Now, downloading this album requires no fewer than <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/godspeed-you-black-emperor-Lift-Your-Skinny-Fists-Like-Antennas-to-Heaven-MP3-Download/10909937.html">24 credits</a>, which is about a third of quota, and about a 600% increase. None of the tracks can be downloaded individually any more.</p>

<p>So you might think, regardless of the increase, that still works out at just over US$10 for an album, which sounds very fair. But this just begs the question: why don&#8217;t they just charge the US$10/album and be done with it?</p>

<p>The subscription plan and the &#8220;credits&#8221; and all that nonsense is just annoying, and that&#8217;s the main reason why I&#8217;m leaving. I can pay US$10/album at <a href="/archives/2007/10/09/easier-than-stealing/">Amazon</a> and I don&#8217;t have to worry about my monthly quota, rollovers, unused credits, the terrible website, the mysteriously &#8220;unavailable&#8221; albums or individual tracks, and all of the other specific problems with the eMusic service.</p>

<p>I admit I had a good ride. And maybe something had to change at eMusic anyway. The whole premise of charging per track is fraught with problems. The economics of this is predicated on 4 min radio-friendly pop songs, and just doesn&#8217;t work out for other types of music.</p>

<p>What I <em>really</em> want is to pay a fixed amount for a fixed <em>duration</em> of music. I&#8217;d easily pay US$1 per 10 minutes of music. It seems like absolutely the fairest and simplest way of doing doing things, and the way that eMusic could have changed while still keeping my business.</p>

<p>Failing that I&#8217;ll just pay per album. But not at eMusic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many carriers, most notably AT&amp;T, but also others such as Optus, are getting a lot of bad press for charging their subscribers extra for &#8220;tethering&#8221; their iPhones to their laptops.</p>

<p>This does seem to be blatant gouging on their part, given that bytes are bytes, and regardless of whether they are destined for a phone or a tethered laptop, the cost is the same. This criticism is warranted in my opinion.</p>

<p>Carriers may claim that tethered laptops inevitably draw more traffic from individual subscribers. But I would suggest that the incremental traffic from a tethered laptop is a <em>lot</em> lower for the iPhone than for other 3G phones. Let&#8217;s face it, the iPhone is a pretty capable standalone device, and you&#8217;ll rarely need to break out the laptop to get online. Other phones are <em>far</em> inferior at browsing the net directly, and so I&#8217;d expect that there is a correspondingly larger proportion of traffic from tethered laptops of subscribers with these phones. This makes the additional pricing seem even more unfair.</p>

<p>But not all of the hate should be directed towards the carriers.</p>

<p>I am yet to see an answer to this question: how do the carriers know which traffic originates from the iPhone itself and which from a tethered laptop? I don&#8217;t know the answer definitively but I the iPhone must mark the tethered traffic somehow. I&#8217;m guessing that it must pass through the PPP session from the laptop, instead of terminating it in the phone and NATting the traffic.</p>

<p>Regardless, it is Apple that deserves at least some of the blame here for <em>enabling</em> the carriers to detect traffic in the first place. I know of no technical reason why they needed to do this; it sounds like a purely business decision. And one they didn&#8217;t need to make; surely the carriers are all Apple&#8217;s bitches at this point?</p>

<p>Boo, carriers who charge for tethering. Boo, Apple.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, before boarding a flight up to Hamilton Island for a $WORK <del>junket</del> conference, I purchased a puzzle book. On the flight, I shared the puzzles amongst colleagues, and fun was had. One particularly tricky puzzle confounded us all, although I recognised it as a variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>. Alarm bells should be going off at this point for those who have debated the subject in the past&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, one colleague didn&#8217;t believe that the answer in the back of the book was correct, and he offered to bet that by running a computer simulation he could prove the book (and me) wrong. I&#8217;m not a betting person, but for some reason, possibly euphoria at the prospect of the upcoming <del>partying</del> seminars, I immediately accepted his bet, wagering $100.</p>

<p>What follows is my attempt to win that bet.</p>

<p><span id="more-3890"></span></p>

<p>So that there is no argument, I&#8217;ll reproduce the exact wording of the problem as stated in the puzzle book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>90.</strong> Four different pieces of candy are placed in a bag. One is chocolate, one is caramel, and two are licorice. Without looking in the bag, I draw two pieces of candy from it, and place one of them, which is licorice, on a table.</p>
  
  <p>What are the chances that the second piece of candy I have in my hand is the other piece of licorice candy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My colleague said the answer is ⅓, simply because the candy in the hand can only be one of three other candies still unseen. Of course this is a classic Monty Hall conditional probability problem, and he is quite wrong.</p>

<p>The key insight to this puzzle is that when I (as the person stating the puzzle) am putting the piece of candy on the table I am <em>selecting</em> it. Just as Monty does when he picks the door with the goat. There&#8217;s no element of randomness.</p>

<p>So the correct way to assess the probability is to think about the possible combinations of candies in your hand. There are six: the chocolate and caramel, caramel and either licorice, chocolate and either licorice, and the two licorice. Now we know that one of these combinations, the chocolate and caramel, is not possible. There are five remaining possibilities, and one of these is the one we want. Hence the odds are ⅕.</p>

<p>Anyway the agreed method of settling the bet was to write a computer simulation, so I did just that. Here is the output of a sample run:</p>

<pre><code>Out of 1000000 tries, two licorices were extracted 200432 times.
Estimated probability = 0.200432
</code></pre>

<p>We have a winner. Thanks JT, cash will be fine.</p>

<p>Here is the C++ code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;tr1/array&gt;

const long iterations = 1000000;

enum candy {
    chocolate,
    caramel,
    licorice
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ::srand(::time(NULL));

    // Number of times we've pulled out two licorice from the bag
    long two_licorice = 0;

    for(long i = 0; i &lt; iterations;)
    {
        // put the candies in the bag
        std::tr1::array&lt;candy, 4&gt; bag = {{ chocolate, caramel, licorice, licorice }};

        // shuffle them
        std::random_shuffle(bag.begin(), bag.end());

        // pull out two
        std::tr1::array&lt;candy, 2&gt; hand = {{ bag[0], bag[1] }};

        // At least one of the candies we pick out must be a licorice otherwise it doesn't count.
        if (hand[0] != licorice &amp;&amp; hand[1] != licorice)
            continue;

        // Count if we've got both licorice
        if (hand[0] == licorice &amp;&amp; hand[1] == licorice)
            ++two_licorice;

        ++i;
    }

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Out of " &lt;&lt; iterations
              &lt;&lt; " tries, two licorices were extracted " &lt;&lt; two_licorice &lt;&lt; " times.\n"
              &lt;&lt; "Estimated probability = "
              &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;double&gt;(two_licorice) / static_cast&lt;double&gt;(iterations)
              &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paypal sent me an email in Feb 2006. Here&#8217;s what they said (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Alastair Rankine, </p>
  
  <p><strong>Welcome to PayPal Australia!</strong></p>
  
  <p>We are pleased to confirm that as of 2 February 2006, PayPal Australia Pty Limited is now providing the PayPal Service to you. </p>
  
  <p>You do not need to take any action, however we do recommend that you review the updated and localised user agreement and privacy policy at a time convenient to you. </p>
  
  <p>["Tip of the Day" elided]</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>Paypal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the benefit of anyone else who received such an email, here&#8217;s my best attempt at translating it from PalSpeak into English.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Chump,</p>
  
  <p><strong>Welcome to PayPal Australia!</strong></p>
  
  <p>We are pleased to confirm that as of 2 February 2006, your PayPal account is now vaguely associated with the country of Australia, but probably not in the way you expect.</p>
  
  <p>You to not need to take any action, just prepare yourself to get fleeced when you next receive an AUD payment. Because we&#8217;ve secretly kept your &#8220;default currency&#8221; as USD, we can now charge you currency exchange fees to convert an AUD payment into USD and back again! So instead of the regular 3.4% fees, you&#8217;re now looking at upwards of 10%!</p>
  
  <p>Isn&#8217;t that great &mdash; for us? Why we chose to keep your default currency as USD is a complete mystery to you, and that&#8217;s the way we like it.</p>
  
  <p>If you don&#8217;t like this arrangement you can always choose to not use PayPal whenever you next sell something on eBay.</p>
  
  <p>Ha ha! No, of course you can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s just our little joke.</p>
  
  <p>Looking forward to fleecing you, chump.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>PayPal</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately the Rudd government are pressing forward with their <a href="/archives/2008/1/3/where-s-the-mandatory-filtering-for-government-stupidity">proposal for mandatory internet filtering</a>. Recently, Electronic Frontiers Australia <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/2008/07/31/efa-says-filtering-trial-a-failure/">summarised the results</a> of an <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310554/isp-level_internet_content_filtering_trial-report.pdf">analysis of current ISP-level filters</a> commissioned by my old <a href="/archives/2006/2/10/a-futile-gesture">mates</a> at <acronym title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">ACMA</acronym>. The figures are frankly <em>begging</em> to be plugged into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes&#8217; Theorem</a>, so let&#8217;s do that.</p>

<p><span id="more-3233"></span></p>

<p>Firstly some terms. Let &#8220;P&#8221; be the event of discovering a Porn site on the internet. Let &#8220;N&#8221; be the converse event: discovering a Non-porn site. Let &#8220;+&#8221; be the event of a postive detection by an ISP filter. And obviously by &#8220;porn&#8221; I mean &#8220;inappropriate material&#8221;, the definition of which may or may not coincide with the Government&#8217;s; for the (admittedly rhetorical) purposes of this exercise it doesn&#8217;t matter too much.</p>

<p>One of the key assumptions we have to make is P(P), or the probability of discovering a porn site. Obviously this depends greatly on how hard you&#8217;re searching for it! Now I don&#8217;t know about you, but I find that I almost <em>never</em> stumble upon a porn site by accident. Almost all of my regular news sources are relatively clean, or use the NSFW tag generously. But I&#8217;m quite happy to concede that my web habits are non-representative. So let&#8217;s just assume a regular family internet connection with a moderate amount of parental supervision, with a 5% chance of accidentally stumbling on porn. This still seems quite high, but it will suffice for now.</p>

<p>To do the calculation we also need:</p>

<ul>
<li>P(N), which is pretty obviously 1 &#8211; P(P), or 0.95.</li>
<li>P(+|P) is the probability of a positive detection by the filter, given a porn site. According to the report, this varies from 87&ndash;98%. Let&#8217;s be generous and say a probability of 0.95.</li>
<li>P(+|N) is the probability of a false positive detection by the filter. Again the results vary, this time from 1.3&ndash;7.8%. Let&#8217;s use a similarly generous probability of 0.04.</li>
<li>P(+) is the probability of a positive detection given any input. This is calculated by adding P(+|P) × P(P) and P(+|N) × P(N).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now using Bayes&#8217; Theorem we can calculate P(P|+). In other words: if a filter blocks a given site, what is the probability that it was porn?</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.05 / ( 0.95 × 0.05 + 0.04 × 0.95 )
       = 0.55
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, <strong>each time the filter blocks something there is an about even chance that it wasn&#8217;t porn</strong>. In my opinion this is sufficiently damning evidence to show the worthlessness of any of these filters.</p>

<p>So obviously we made some assumptions about the prevalence of porn, and hence the probability of discovering it. If we assume the internet is 50% porn, then the filter starts to look vaguely effective:</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.5 / (0.95 × 0.5 + 0.04 × 0.5)
       = 0.96
</code></pre>

<p>But this is clearly a ridiculous assumption. If, on the other hand, we say that P(P) is lower, maybe a 1% chance of stumbling on porn &mdash; which frankly still sounds high to me &mdash; then the filters look even more useless:</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.01 / ( 0.95 × 0.01 + 0.04 × 0.99 )
       = 0.19
</code></pre>

<p>So if the filter is blocking something, there&#8217;s an 80% chance that it wasn&#8217;t porn! Fantastic! For some reason these calculations seem to be missing from the ACMA report.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/censorship/mandatory-isp-blocking/">EFA analysis</a> for more on the mandatory filtering, and while you&#8217;re there, join up. I have.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;re watching a new TV show and you&#8217;re hooked. It&#8217;s clever, the characters are believable, the dialog is witty, the cinematography is inspired, the direction is tight and the plot is engaging. You want to see more. You&#8217;re in love. With a TV show.</p>

<p><span id="more-2933"></span></p>

<h4>Jumping The Shark</h4>

<p>A few episodes, or a few seasons, later you start to see flaws. The formula of the show is revealing itself to you and you fall out of love. Perhaps you still watch but eventually you&#8217;ll give it away. &#8220;Jumping the shark&#8221; is a tired cliche that is <a href="/archives/2005/1/5/essentials-for-windows">often deployed</a> at times like this, to indicate that the show has run its course and the production team are attempting to wring more content out of an essentially used premise.</p>

<p>But sometimes it&#8217;s not the show that has changed. You, as a viewer have just grown a little more insightful, matured a bit maybe, your belief suspenders snap and you&#8217;re no longer at home in the show&#8217;s fictional world. As when relationships between people break down, there are often reasons on both sides.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>For me, <cite>Lost</cite> is a good example. After an initial flurry of <a href="/archives/2006/1/12/working-the-numbers">enthusiasm</a> I became frustrated with the glacial pace of the plot, eventually confirming initial fears that yes indeed it did suffer from the <cite>X-Files</cite> syndrome of the perpetually imminent revelation. But the show hadn&#8217;t changed by the time I stopped watching; it was like that from the start. I just expected it to proceed differently to the way it did.</p></div>

<p>The same disillusionment can of course apply to other media, although it tends to be more apparent in serialised media such as TV shows &#8230; and websites.</p>

<h4>Coding Horror</h4>

<p>Recently I have become disillusioned with Jeff Atwood&#8217;s blog called Coding Horror. Now of course this event wouldn&#8217;t normally warrant an article on my own blog, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be relieved to hear that I am not planning to write lengthy explanations anytime I hit the Unsubscribe button. However in this case I believe that some detailed criticism needs to made, as I&#8217;m sure many of you are also Coding Horror readers.</p>

<p>I was initially attracted to Atwood&#8217;s blog for its relatively simple premise and smart delivery. With startling regularity over an extended time he managed to deliver bite-sized morsels relating to the stated domain of programming and human factors. He writes well and generally illustrates his point in a clear and easy to digest style. It&#8217;s quite engaging.</p>

<p>As an individual blogger I cannot help but admire the dedication and sheer persistence on display here. Over the years he has managed to churn out many substantive articles, far more than I ever will on girtby.net, for example. And there is a lot of great material there.</p>

<p>So, a dude with a blog, why would I rag on him in public, you might wonder. You would be completely justified in asking whether I am motivated by jealousy or some other malice, perhaps because he is so much more prolific and popular than I. These are good questions and if he were just another average Joe developer trying to better himself through blogging, I certainly should be keeping my opinions to myself.</p>

<p>However, Coding Horror has become so popular that Atwood has quit his day job and struck out on his own. To my mind, this raises the bar somewhat. Professional bloggers deserve more scrutiny than dabblers, just as in many other fields.</p>

<p>Not only has Atwood has gone pro with is blog, but has recently started a venture called stackoverflow to collate accepted wisdom from the software development community. It is early days, but from what I can gather there is still likely to be Atwood&#8217;s editorial hand in the output, despite intentions of adopting community generated content.</p>

<p>In other words, Atwood seems to be setting himself up as an authority figure on software development and, well, I have some issues with this.</p>

<h4>Blogging Horror</h4>

<p>The bite-sized morsels posted to Coding Horror are all very well for bite-sized topics. But things can often go awry if the topic is too complex to be distilled down easily. Oversimplification often ensues, as in the following examples, all recent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001114.html">attempted critique of XML</a> makes a case that XML is difficult for humans to read. He gives some dodgy examples &mdash; including a SOAP message of all things &mdash; but completely misses the point that XML is intended as a good <em>compromise</em> between machine-readable and human-readable. Sure the alternatives may look simpler, but show us the <em>code to parse them</em>. In grudgingly accepting that XML is OK for some tasks, Atwood gives no clue as to what those tasks might be. To me, the entire article reads like someone who has looked at an XML fragment and had an adverse reaction without any understanding as to why it is, and perhaps should be, the way it is. (Norm Walsh on the other hand, understands probably more than anyone, and provides a <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2008/05/13/thetax">polite rebuttal</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>A similar &#8220;it&#8217;s-too-hard&#8221; reaction seems to be at the heart of an article on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001115.html">humane markup languages</a> such as Markdown, Textile, etc. His conclusion is that he&#8217;d &#8220;rather rely on a subset of trusty old HTML than expend brain cells trying to remember the fake-HTML way&#8221;. The oversimplification here is in not realising that Markdown (and possibly others) accept all HTML tags anyway and it adds value by being more readable and writable. If nothing else, Markdown makes it possible to conduct discussions <em>about</em> HTML without going completely insane. I expect hilarity to ensue on his stackoverflow project once people start contributing code snippets with angle brackets embedded deep within. I wonder how many brain cells will be expended on entity escaping.</p></li>
<li><p>Admittedly Model-View-Controller is an increasingly vague concept these days, but I just couldn&#8217;t buy <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001112.html">Atwood&#8217;s example</a> of it; HTML = model, CSS = view, and of all things, browser = controller. For starters these things aren&#8217;t even of the same kind; HTML and CSS are declarative languages and the browser is a piece of software. If you&#8217;re going to apply the MVC concept that broadly, why not make the controller, I dunno, the mouse? Or the user? And surely if anything is the model in this case it is the DOM? On their <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/podcast-4/">podcast</a>, Joel Spolsky took Atwood to task a little bit over his application of MVC to the web, and it&#8217;s worth a listen.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001117.html">comment</a> that software forking is &#8220;the very embodiment of freedom zero&#8221; demonstrates that Atwood has no idea <a href="/archives/2008/1/30/freedom-zero">what freedom zero is</a>. Freedom zero is the freedom to run the software in question without modification, and forking is inherently modifying the software, hence doesn&#8217;t even enter into consideration of freedom zero.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Common to all of these are a superficial understanding of the topic at hand. In short, Atwood just <em>isn&#8217;t credible</em>.</p>

<p>(I have also had cause to disagree with his opinion on many matters, but this is not in itself a good reason to dismiss him. Neither is his seeming obsession with, but never ownership of, recent products from Apple; I&#8217;m not sure what to make of that.)</p>

<h4>Instant Developer Credibility, Just Add Code</h4>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/04/podcast-2/">podcast</a>, Atwood disclosed recently that he had never learned C, one of my <a href="/archives/2008/5/11/developer-essentials">developer essentials</a>. To me, this revelation is a profound hit to his credibility; it is like finding out that the chef who cooked your meal is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_30%25_Iron_Chef">robot with no sense of taste or smell</a>.</p>

<p>So what language does Atwood use to illustrate his articles on the finer points of programming? Well here&#8217;s the really puzzling thing. I can&#8217;t remember reading a single article on Coding Horror which actually included any original code, horrible or otherwise. I&#8217;ve got a vague recollection of a Coding Horror article which incorporated some third-party code, though I can&#8217;t remember the topic now.</p>

<p>To be honest I should have realised this as a problem a lot sooner. Now that I think about it, <em>all</em> of the other coding-related blogs I read regularly are imparted with credibility through the code that is posted to them, or by the projects in which their authors are involved. You&#8217;ll note that one of the reasons I <a href="/archives/2006/9/3/decloaking">decloaked</a> myself on this blog was to take advantage of the accumulated credibility from (mainly) the code posted here.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, I&#8217;m sure the stackoverflow project will be a great opportunity to <em>demonstrate</em> Jeff Atwood&#8217;s abilities as a software developer and bridge the credibility gap.</p>

<h4>It&#8217;s Not Me, It&#8217;s You. And Me.</h4>

<p>So, getting back to the question about leaping over metaphorical aquatic predators. Like I said, there are often reasons on both sides as to why the author and the audience member part ways. Sometimes it&#8217;s them, sometimes it&#8217;s you, and sometimes it&#8217;s both.</p>

<p>Here, I think it&#8217;s a bit of both. It seems quite apparent that Jeff Atwood has stepped outside his expertise recently, and that this is something he did comparatively rarely in the past. I haven&#8217;t gone groveling through his past posts, but from my recollection I&#8217;m pretty sure his hit rate used to be better.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve changed my attitudes also, having learned to be a better assessor of credibility, and more suspicious of short answers to complex issues. And of those who don&#8217;t demonstrate their developer credibility by actually posting code. I always thought that brevity was <a href="/archives/2004/12/8/the-most-important-feature-of-a-successful-blog-post">a good thing</a> for blog articles, but <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/01/blogging-theory-201-size-does-matter.html">maybe not</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, I&#8217;m going to look elsewhere for good writing on software development. What about you? Are you a Coding Horror fan?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Specialised web forums are commonplace these days. They cover the entirety of the long tail, and are therefore indispensable for discussing obscure, and not-so-obscure, topics.</p>

<p>These days I wouldn&#8217;t consider making any serious purchase without at least a brief consulation of the relevant web forum. Technical problems with just about anything can usually be resolved with a well-crafted search through the appropriate forum. Put simply, the web forum is the basic unit of online community these days.</p>

<p>But despite their ubiquity and obvious utility they remain frustratingly limited in lots of ways. In this post I vent some of these frustrations.</p>

<p><span id="more-2694"></span></p>

<h4>In The Beginning Was &#8230;</h4>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">command line</a>. But some time after that came the Internet. And some time after that, but before the advent of the web, came Usenet. It still exists and, despite its bad reputation, is actually still worthwhile for &#8230; <a href="/archives/2004/10/5/too-legit-to-quit">certain</a> types of content.</p>

<p>The problems with Usenet have been apparent for about as long as Usenet itself. In fact, there is an entire chapter of the classic <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~daniel/unix-haters.html">Unix-Haters Handbook</a> devoted to it. For me, the problems stemmed from the fact that there was a single heirarchy of groups which needed to satisfy everyone, and ended up satisfying no one. That there should be one taxonomy for all of human discorse is an obvious falsehood. It probably came about from the single, but distributed, administration structure which underpinned all of Usenet.</p>

<p>For a while there it looked like some of these problems were going to be mitigated through the use of private News servers. This allowed use of the Usenet software and protocols, but allowed anyone to be an administrator, and hence decide on the group hierarchy, rules and policies. I remember frequenting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx">3dfx</a> News server to find the latest and greatest information about the Voodoo Rush graphics boards, back in the day.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason these did not take off. Despite commonly-available client software (such as in Outlook Express and in Netscape Navigator), private News servers did not proliferate as much as web-based forums, and so are pretty rare today. At the time I felt that web forums were a step backward, and, I still feel that private News servers are superiour to web forums in many ways, despite the latter enjoying many years of active development.</p>

<h4>Set My Data Free</h4>

<p>Well, as you <a href="/archives/2008/1/30/freedom-zero">might guess</a> my biggest problem is that of Free Data. I have never seen web forum software supporting a data export feature where I could retrieve my own posts. The most widely-deployed forum application, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin">vBulletin</a> does not, as far as I can tell anyway, support <em>any</em> form of automated interface, and is not particularly unusual in this regard.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>It should be pointed out that most blog software, including the software used to run this blog, fails the Free Data test too. There is no easy way for commenters to retrieve their comments from this blog in any well-documented format. We (blog owners) all probably need to Do Better here, particularly if we&#8217;re going to bang on about the importance of Free Data.</p></div>

<p>The best you can do currently is to search for your own posts, and manually extract the contents of each result page. This is quite unfeasible in the general case, and also it is lossy because the rendered HTML rarely matches the raw content of each post.</p>

<h4>Usability</h4>

<p>The other main problems with web fora &mdash; as currently implemented by vBulletin and equivalents, at least &mdash; concern usability. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Searching</strong> a web forum is almost aways an incredibly painful experience. The results are often presented as a list of <em>threads</em>, often with no clue as to the context of the search terms within. You generally have to search <em>again</em> within the thread to find out whether or not the original search result is even relevant. Just madness.</p></li>
<li><p>Each web forum seems to implement its own <strong>markup</strong> for posts. The result is usually a variant of HTML with square brackets instead of angle brackets and a slightly different syntax. The question &#8220;why not just use HTML?&#8221; comes to mind. The JavaScript editor widgets are generally awful and often very little help in inserting the correct markup.</p></li>
<li><p>And speaking of markup, why are forums themselves generally so <strong>HTML heavy</strong>? I&#8217;m looking at a topic index page right now which is over 100K of HTML, and yet contains only 32 topics (including a half-dozen or so of the obligatory &#8220;Sticky&#8221; threads). 100K doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but when you&#8217;re navigating back and forth all the time, it can really add up. And as for access from a mobile browser, forget it.</p></li>
<li><p>Annoying <strong>subtle differences</strong> in basic functions makes it very difficult to go from one forum to another. Do you manually subscribe to topics, or is it automatic when you reply to a thread? And how do you view new replies in subscribed topics? (On one of my regular forums it is under &#8220;Preferences&#8221;, under most others it&#8217;s &#8220;UserCP&#8221;.) Controls for common tasks are distributed seemingly at random, in accordance with the whim of the site administrator&#8217;s preferences (and usually difficult to guess).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Social Dynamics</h4>

<p>Almost invariably web forums actively promote a social hierarchy amongst the participants. It is extremely common for forums to display the post count and join date for each member next to each post. This is obviously a benefit for site administrators as it attracts participants, specifically those who care about such metrics.</p>

<p>The post count is a particularly prized visible badge of honour. People seem to go to ridiculous lengths, posting the most banal of comments, all in the name of increasing their post count. MMORPG players chasing ever higher levels exhibit similar behaviour I think, and <a href="http://www.forumwarz.com/">evidently</a> I&#8217;m not the only person to notice the similarity.</p>

<p>Of course all communication online is subject to (sometimes unpredictable) effects by the technology, and you should consult <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> about those. However I find it mildly frustrating that forums are often so polluted polluted with one-liners, non-sequiturs and other fluff all as a result of affording the participant&#8217;s post count such high visibility.</p>

<h4>Bring Back NNTP!</h4>

<p>What makes all these problems, and a myriad of other little ones I haven&#8217;t bothered mentioning, is that they were far less of a problem with the NNTP technology we used before the advent of web forums. And there&#8217;s no reason why NNTP couldn&#8217;t be reinstated.</p>

<p>In fact there are forums which provide both web and NNTP interfaces. Like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/forums/news/using.html">Adobe&#8217;s</a> for one.</p>

<p>The only downside with NNTP is that there is, as far as I understand anyway, no way to communicate to the server which posts have been read and which are still unread. This really needs to be tackled, but I&#8217;m sure the web forum vendors could get together to drive an NNTP extension in this area.</p>

<p>But maybe NNTP is too obsolete to rescue. Maybe the solution is just to kick the forum software vendors to lift their game. Either way I&#8217;m happy, actually.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I generally agree unequivocally with Bruce Schneier, but his recent column on <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2008/02/securitymatters_0207">vendor lock-in</a> has me wanting to take issue with some of his points.</p>

<p>Vendor lock-in is real, but the example he gives of the iPhone is <em>not</em> a very good one. Why? Because it&#8217;s easy to switch: you call up the carrier (AT&amp;T in this case) and say &#8220;I don&#8217;t like my iPhone, it&#8217;s too sleek and good looking and it&#8217;s user interface is too elegant. Instead I&#8217;d like to subject myself to some nonsense from the traditional handset vendors.&#8221; To which the AT&amp;T person says &#8220;sure, we&#8217;ll charge you $X and ship out a new handset. When it arrives, just activate and transfer your contacts.&#8221; Bingo, you&#8217;re off the iPhone.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Andrew points out in <a href="/archives/2008/2/8/vendor-lock-in#comment-2657">comments</a> that the 24-month contract may impede switching in this manner. I don't know the details, but I'd be surprised if it was <em>impossible</em> to switch away from the iPhone, merely <em>expensive</em>. This is, to my mind anyway, not sufficient to justify the term "vendor lock-in", but I suppose that depends on your definition. My definition is below.]</p>

<p>In Australia we have number portability which means that I can generally switch handset or carrier without too much fuss. I&#8217;m not sure about the situation in the US, but as illustrated above you are still free to switch handsets while keeping the same carrier. So if there&#8217;s lock-in at play here, it&#8217;s lock-in to AT&amp;T, not the iPhone.</p>

<p>So what is vendor lock-in anyway? I would define it as the presence of constraints on a given product or service that are imposed by the vendor and which prevent you from switching to a different product. These constraints may take the form of missing features which would enable a switch, or of usage constraints imposed by licensing, or both. Either way there has been an explicit decision &mdash; technical or policy &mdash; by the vendor which prevents switching to a competitive product. Hence the term is a mild pejorative.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a slightly confusing term because it applies to a product or service, and not to the vendor. So it&#8217;s quite possible for product X to exhibit vendor lock-in, but not product Y from the same vendor. &#8220;Vendor-<em>imposed</em> lock-in&#8221; might be a better term.</p>

<p>Note that there is an implicit assumption that the features and capabilities of the product in question are available elsewhere in the marketplace. In other words, there exists an equivalent product to switch to. This assumption does not always hold, and sometimes you may find yourself unable to switch to a different product, simply because there are no other products on the market with a given capability or feature. This does <em>not</em>, by my definition anyway, constitute vendor lock-in, because the inability to switch does not arise as a result of a decision from the vendor.</p>

<p>Does the lack of an SDK constitute vendor lock-in for the iPhone, as claimed by Schneier? Well, does the lack of this feature prevent switching to a different product? No, of course it doesn&#8217;t, as illustrated above.</p>

<p>In fact, it is the <em>presence</em> of an SDK which constitutes vendor lock-in, of a sort. Third-party applications written to the iPhone cannot, by definition, be easily be ported to other mobile platforms. If you suddenly decide you don&#8217;t like your iPhone any more, but have hundreds of third-party applications installed, you have a problem.</p>

<p>This problem is common to all computing platforms; vendor lock-in is a necessary consequence of all vendor-controlled SDKs and APIs.</p>

<p>Incidentally the delay in making an iPhone SDK available can quite easily be explained by the technical challenges involved, and does not neccesarily imply any policy decision by Apple to deliberately lock out third-party developers. Producing an SDK of any quality is a hard task, and the instant it is released it has to be supported for the life of the product. As Charles Miller <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/10/04/the_iphone_and_public_apis">puts it</a>, &#8220;third party apps are for life, not just for Christmas&#8221;. It is quite understandable that Apple would make sure their SDK is <em>just right</em> before committing to it.</p>

<p>But where does the &#8220;no SDK == lock-in&#8221; idea come from anyway? I suspect that it arises from the <em>expectation</em> that we are able to install third-party applications on the iPhone. Where does the expectation come from? It comes from the disclosed fact that the iPhone runs OS X. If Apple had not divulged this fact, or if the iPhone ran some un-named OS &mdash; as is the case for all classic iPods, for example &mdash; there would be no expectation of third-party applications. It is for this reason no one is claiming that the lack of an iPod SDK exhibits vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>However, Schneier claims that there <em>is</em> vendor lock-in on the iPod, due to the fact that &#8220;music purchased from Apple for your iPod won&#8217;t work on other brands of music players&#8221;. This is misleading; it is quite possible to purchase DRM-free music from Apple for the iPod and other players. Again, he&#8217;s incorrectly identified the source of the vendor lock-in, which in this case is <em>certain</em> music from the iTunes Store and not the iPod.</p>

<p>To reiterate, vendor lock-in is real and is important. It is contrary to the idea of <a href="/archives/2008/1/30/freedom-zero">Free Data</a> and deserves to be more widely discussed. However, let&#8217;s first understand what we are talking about, so that we can think critically.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still in holiday mode and have not spent much time online studying the reaction to the idiotic mandatory filtering proposals from the new Rudd government, but I expect <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,22997280-15306,00.html">this editorial</a> published in the Australian is mostly representative. I disagree with none of it.</p>

<p>However I just can&#8217;t help passing further comment, mainly because there is a lengthy discussion in the <a href="/archives/2007/12/20/code-2-0">previously-mentioned Lessig book</a> which outlines what I would consider an acceptable regulatory framework for controlling access to content online. So please feel free to <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/codev2/index.cgi?free_speech">peruse it</a> for yourself (the section titled &#8220;Regulating Net-Porn&#8221; in particular), but it might be summarised as requiring publishers to rate their content in accordance with pre-existing legal standards (eg a &#8220;harmful to minors&#8221; HTML tag), which would in turn create a market for end-user filtering technology.</p>

<p>But instead of this, what are we getting? Mandatory (but perhaps a per-customer &#8216;opt-out&#8217; ability) filtering of some vaguely defined standard using not-at-all defined technology and with not-at-all defined procedures for redress of inappropriate filtering. Just like the <a href="/archives/2005/12/8/ip-access-list-100-deny-from-future">internet connection at work</a>, in other words.</p>

<p>The point that strikes me upon reading Lessig&#8217;s book is that <em>if</em> filtering is to be performed (and I reiterate the point that I am not against it) it is better that it be performed by the government, in accordance with acknowledged moral standards, with process transparency and accountability. None of these are guaranteed (nor likely) if private interests are involved in filtering our content. As Lessig says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has taken key civil rights organizations too long to recognize this private threat to free-speech values. The tradition of civil rights is focused directly on government action alone. I would be the last to say that there’s not great danger from government misbehavior. But there is also danger to free speech from private misbehavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in handing the filtering problem to the ISPs, the government is effectively absolving themselves of the responsibility to implement it as intended. ISPs will of course implement the content filtering using the cheapest solution they can find, even if the <a href="/archives/2007/4/1/i-want-a-pony-domain">false-positive rate is 99.5%</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand they could require the ISPs to block sites on <acronym title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">ACMA</acronym>&#8217;s blacklist. And we all know <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001009.html">how well</a> <em>that</em> will work, right kids? But the point is that at least with ACMA you have <a href="/archives/2006/2/10/a-futile-gesture">some recourse</a>.</p>

<p>I think that requiring government accountability is the key to ensuring an acceptable outcome. If they are serious about the problem of content finding an inappropriate audience, lets see them <em>own</em> that problem, not just outsource it to the ISPs and hope for the best.</p>
