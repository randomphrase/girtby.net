		<description>&lt;p&gt;I assume that the problem I experienced was because the road was behind schedule. One might imagine that a map upgrade would include roads under construction, with a date on which to start using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve also experienced the &#039;slip road&#039; problem a few times on this trip; where there is a local service road running alongside a freeway, I&#039;ve seen the system get confused as to whether I was still on the freeway or not. It&#039;s disconcerting, to say the least, when the voice pipes up beside you to say &#039;recalculating route&#039; as you whizz towards a major intersection....&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I was speaking with the IT manager of the Melbourne fire brigade yesterday (as one does) about introducing GPS units into their trucks. They are specifically looking at mounting hand-held units rather than buying built-in units because the vendors do map and software updates more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the aftermarket in-dash units look pretty nice too. I remember seeing an episode of Top Gear (my secret addiction) where they &quot;tested&quot; a Pioneer (I think it was) GPS unit against ... a homing pigeon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pigeon won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the GPS system looked very nice. Apparently it changed route mid-journey to avoid an accident-related traffic jam.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;My worst experience was driving out of Newark airport in NJ.  I swear the navigation system had a Z axis problem.  I was driving on a road that was elevated above another road and I kept following its instructions and driving around and around.  After a while I turned it off, drove five minutes in a random direction re-punched my destination and it managed to navigate me back to the road &lt;em&gt;underneath&lt;/em&gt; the one I was driving back and forth, and around and around on.  This reset seemed to be the circuit-breaker that got me to my hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Thinking about these different types of problems with GPS
systems, it strikes me that the fundamental cause is the lack of a feedback
loop for continuous improvement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be interested in this rumour in a CNET review of the &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com.au/pdas/gps/0,239035573,339283974,00.htm&quot;&gt;TomTom
Go 720&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sensis have reportedly put the kibosh on the Map Share feature,
which allows users to make corrections to the maps, as well download
corrections that others have made.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
