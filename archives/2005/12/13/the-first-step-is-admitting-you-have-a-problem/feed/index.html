		<description>&lt;p&gt;You need to relax and get comfortable. Sometimes you have to repudiate your values in order to save them. I suggest  studying &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; if you are having trouble with this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a lot that&#039;s been said (over talk-back radio) that&#039;s pretty infuriating (or hilarious, depending on how you listen). &quot;I wear broad shorts too, I think I should have a right to use this beach.&quot; or &quot;A lot of these people, &#039;lebs&#039; for want of a better word, claim they were born in this country, so they have as much right to use the beach as anyone else.&quot; I like someone who wrote into &quot;Sunrise&quot; with &quot;If we peeled off our flesh we&#039;d all be the same underneath.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I met the last guy on the street, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d rather he were racist.&lt;/p&gt;
