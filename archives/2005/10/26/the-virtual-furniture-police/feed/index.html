		<description>&lt;p&gt;It must the zeitgeist: Paul Graham&#039;s OSCON 2005 speech (available at IT Conversations) strikes much the same nerve, describing in comic detail how traditional workplaces stifle productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You know I couldn&#039;t put my finger on exactly what the &quot;system problem&quot; (It&#039;s not you, it&#039;s THE SYSTEM) was. I think I have it. We had a work function which involved Karaoke (Sad I know...but). I had a video camera there and shot it off to a CD and brought it into work. Unfortunately, since we are not allowed to have sound on any of our mahines at work, the true impact  of a drunk Chinese anesthesiologist singing &quot;Your cheating heart&quot; was lost. :( Now I know why I feel oppressed!&lt;/p&gt;
