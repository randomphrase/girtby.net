		<description>&lt;p&gt;I bought two albums recently. I only ripped one from it&#039;s packaging, but I still haven&#039;t even opened the case, much less put it in a CD player of some sort. This is because I&#039;d already downloaded the albums. If I somehow lose the mp3s, I&#039;d just download them again. It takes a significant amount of effort and time to rip a CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What software are you using? iTunes is teh win. Downloading the album cover art is the most time-consuming part of ripping a CD as far as I&#039;m concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve always found &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CDex&lt;/a&gt; to be simplicity itself when it comes to ripping CDs. Owning an original Create Nomad Jukebox (with the 6GB drive, back when that was a big deal, and it was one of the only HDD-based mp3 players around) made finding good tools a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit I haven&#039;t listened to all of the CDs I&#039;ve bought recently, but I still listen to CDs at home and in the car (disc rotation in the car takes a while, and I prefer to mix the new with the old). When I find a decent mp3 player that can plug into a good component sound system and not look like a lump of crap [hint: it should look like a modern slimline DVD player, not a vertical beige box], and I find the right way to listen to mp3s in the car, then I suppose I&#039;ll never have the pleasure of prizing a CD loose from its transparent plastic prison again. On the plus side, I won&#039;t worry about the broken tines, hinges or cracks in that plastic either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you ever see an mp3 playing alarm clock, that would make my day. No longer would I have to put up with other people&#039;s lousy DJing abilities. I&#039;d only have to suffer my own.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;And another thing: I think you meant flout (as in &quot;La! La! La! I&#039;m ignoring copyright law&quot;), not flaunt (as in &quot;Look at me! I&#039;ve got some copyright law!&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least it&#039;s not a effect/affect spelling fuck-up. Here&#039;s a simple explanation for those who might be confused. Reading a review can affect my purchase, because the review had an effect on me. Handing over the money effects my purchase, because the exchange of money directly affects the sale, and it is the only reason for the effect. Using effect correctly may just be an affectation, but a tip you may find effective is to use &#039;affect&#039; first, and only when that sounds wrong, switch to &#039;effect&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks Richard for flaunting your usage skillz. Your comment affected me effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS X Dictionary app has a relevant usage note which I will now memorise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;USAGE &lt;strong&gt;Flaunt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flout&lt;/strong&gt; may sound similar but they have different meanings. Flaunt means ‘display ostentatiously,’ as in: &lt;em&gt;tourists who liked to &lt;strong&gt;flaunt&lt;/strong&gt; their wealth&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;flout&lt;/strong&gt; means ‘openly disregard (a rule or convention),’ as in &#124; &lt;em&gt;new recruits growing their hair and &lt;strong&gt;flouting&lt;/strong&gt; convention&lt;/em&gt;. It is a common error, since probably around the 1940s, to use &lt;strong&gt;flaunt&lt;/strong&gt; when &lt;strong&gt;flout&lt;/strong&gt; is intended, as in &#124; the young woman had been flaunting the rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That counter-example sounds vaguely familiar! (Strange punctuation theirs)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It appears to me that there is tacit approval of ripping by the local music industry.  The music industry is using the reality of CDs-as-hardware-tokens to skimp on CD packaging.  They know there&#039;s no point giving you a standardised jewel case with clear writing on the spine because it&#039;s just going to end up sitting in a drawer or cardboard box somewhere once it&#039;s ripped.  Instead you get the type of packaging you&#039;re used to finding in Corn Flakes packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As you know) I purchased three reasonably recent CDs on Friday and all three came in crappy nonstandard cardboard boxes.  Pet Shop Boys&#039; &lt;em&gt;Back to Mine&lt;/em&gt; was so poorly made that the two CDs were wedged into the glue in their slips and almost required me to break the discs to get them out of, and back into, their post-ripping cardboard mausoleums.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a pity really, because it&#039;s always interesting (to me, anyway) to see people&#039;s music collections on display when you walk into their houses. The crappy little slip cases really don&#039;t cut it, as you say. Of course now we display our DVD collections instead, but it seems pretty obvious that these discs are the next candidates to be entombed in cardboard. And what will happen then? How will we get an instant appraisal of someone&#039;s cultural awareness from the comfort of their living room?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s patent the iWallboard:  A digital wallboard display that you can have mounted on your wall where your CD racks would have been in olden times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iWallboard would dispaly random artist, song, album, your rating and date added to collection to stimulate the music-taste discussions of years gone by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what would be the modern day equivalent of lending a friend a CD?  Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;well, I use abcde, which is basically just &quot;type abcde, check that the downloaded tracklisting is OK, wait a bit&quot;. I meant effort as in actually having to add or remove CDs, and having to wait in between. Ripping 3 or 4 CDs is OK, ripping 100 is not OK.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry, conversation moved on and I didn&#039;t notice. Actually, I&#039;ve been having issues with lending friends CDs (or more correctly, my brother lending his friends our CDs). Consequently, I don&#039;t know where most of my collection is, and becuase I don&#039;t actively listen to it, I don&#039;t miss it, so I don&#039;t care and I forget what we bought anyway. I don&#039;t have a nice compartmentalised CD rack like my DVDs on my bookshelf (easy because my brother and friends don&#039;t like anime). It&#039;s kind of annoying finding a CD lying under a pile of books, outside it&#039;s jewel case, scratched to all buggery. Screw CDs.&lt;/p&gt;
