		<description>&lt;p&gt;There may be another workaround, but I haven&#039;t tested it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for you (the web-site owner), but for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/28/_ie_firefox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;80-odd percent&lt;/a&gt; of the Internet users who are clueless noobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure if you can get an updated copy of the Arial font that includes all the relevant Unicode characters, the problem will effectively go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I found that there is such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q287247/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;font already exists&lt;/a&gt;. It is included with late versions of Microsoft Office, but it is not recommended for day-to-day use because of its size (22 MB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could work out how to substitute that font for &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\Font\Arial.ttf&lt;/code&gt;, it would either fix this relatively trivial problem, slow down my computer immensely, or destroy my Windows installation. Hmmm, maybe I will hold off on this experiment until I have a Windows installation I don&#039;t mind trashing. (You may insert your own cynical comment about what percentage of Windows installations that might include, right here.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Nice find, Julian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font installs as described by the knowledgebase article you pointed to. This installs an &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot; font &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to the standard Arial font. So I see why you would want to experiment with substituting this font for the standard Arial font: to fix IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I can verity that merely installing this font fixes the character glyph problems (including the WHITE FROWNING FACE) in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that another fix might be to install the shareware &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.att.net/~jameskass/code2000_page.htm&quot;&gt;Code2000&lt;/a&gt; unicode font. This might be a more economical option than purchasing Microsoft Word if you don&#039;t already have it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm... I remember downloading Arial MS from the internets (for use in Linux, because I didn&#039;t have enough unicode fonts), and I think it may have been on a &quot;microsoft knowledge&quot; type base site somewhere. Something I noticed was that Arial was by far the most complete unicode font they had (at least, it was the largest to download). I think this is why IE does the Arial trick, because it thinks of Arial MS as the &quot;one font to rule them all&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Sunny, you may be thinking of the Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/win.htm&quot;&gt;TrueType core fonts from the Web&lt;/a&gt;? This included some really nice fonts, including Trebuchet and Verdana, two of my faves. It also includes Arial, but I&#039;m pretty sure it is an earlier version. The new Arial is 22MB, whereas the one available for download is in a 500K .exe (I can&#039;t be arsed downloading to see the extracted size, but I&#039;m guessing less than 22MB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;one font to rule them all&quot; idea sounds great (or at least acceptable) - if it worked. As I mentioned above, you end up with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Arial and Arial MS Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Microsoft no longer hosts downloads of these fonts from their site. However they are still widely available thanks to a non-restrictive license, at least that&#039;s what it claims &lt;a href=&quot;http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;on the sourceforge page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
