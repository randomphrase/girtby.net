		        <h3>Internet Explorer Makes Me ☹ 
		        </h3>
		        <p><strike>Suckers</strike> <strike>Clueless n00bs</strike> Discerning users of Microsoft Internet Explorer will have noticed the weird &#8220;missing character&#8221; glyph in the title of a <a href="/archives/2005/10/05/complexity-design/">previous post</a> will no doubt see the title of this post and wonder what the hell I&#8217;m up to. Firefox users on Windows seeing a question mark may be thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>The unusual character in the title of this post is a unicode character, specifically 0&#215;2639, and otherwise known as WHITE FROWNING FACE.</p>

<p>[Incidentally there's no black frowning face in the unicode character set. There is, however, a "&#x263A;" (WHITE SMILING FACE, 0x263A) to go with the "&#x263B;" (BLACK SMILING FACE, 0x263B). Explaining this inconsistency is left as an exercise for the reader.]</p>

<p>The white frowning face isn&#8217;t really a fair character to use on the web. This is because Windows doesn&#8217;t seem to have a glyph for this character in any of the default fonts. So like I said, not exactly fair, but I couldn&#8217;t help myself.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the &#8216;not-implies&#8217; symbol from the title of the <a href="/archives/2005/10/05/complexity-design/">previous post</a> requires a bit more explanation. It displays on almost all modern browsers that I have access to (or could be bothered installing), with one obvious exception. So, why doesn&#8217;t it display on IE? A glyph definitely exists in the default set of Windows fonts for this character &#8211; otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t display in Firefox. So what&#8217;s up?</p>

<p><span id="more-140"></span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s save some time at this point and head straight for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_and_HTML#Web_browser_support">source of all world knowledge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internet Explorer is capable of displaying the full range of Unicode characters, but can&#8217;t automatically make the necessary font choice. Web page authors must guess which appropriate fonts might be present on users&#8217; systems, and manually specify them for each block of text with a different language or Unicode range. A user may have another font installed which would display some characters, but if the web page author hasn&#8217;t specified it, then Explorer will fail to display them, and show placeholder squares instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broken, or what? But I found it isn&#8217;t quite as simple as all that. I had noticed that sometimes IE is able to find the right glyph for special unicode characters, and other times not. Experimentation was called for.</p>

<p>First I picked three fonts to test with: Georgia, Arial, and Lucida Sans Unicode. Using the Windows Character Map application I was able to pick two characters which were present in at most one of the test fonts. The first character was &#8220;&#9829;&#8221; (BLACK HEART SUIT, 0&#215;2665) and is present in Arial but not in the other fonts. The other character chosen was our favourite from last time &#8220;&#8655;&#8221; (RIGHTWARDS DOUBLE ARROW WITH STROKE, 0&#215;21CF), which of the three is only present in Lucida Sans Unicode.</p>

<p>I then created a test page which attempts to display each of the two test characters in each of the three test fonts. Here is a screenshot of the result in IE:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ie-unicode-test.png" height="223" width="429" alt="Screenshot of IE's rendering of test fonts and characters" class="centered" /></p>

<p>The thing to note here is that when a glyph does not exist in the chosen font, but it does exist in Arial, the Arial glyph is displayed. However this is <em>not</em> the case for Lucida Sans Unicode. Arial seems to be special in this way.</p>

<p>So this seems to explain why some unicode characters display and some don&#8217;t. Basically, if it&#8217;s not in the font you select, or in Arial, it&#8217;s not going to get displayed by IE.</p>

<p>Just in case you were wondering, the list of alternative fonts allowed by the CSS <code>font-family</code> selector makes absolutely no difference. I can append Lucida Sans Unicode to the list of fonts used to draw the not-imply arrow, and it gives results identical to those above. Were you thinking you could add a bunch of &#8220;last resort&#8221; fonts like Lucida Sans Unicode to your alternative font list for the document, all for the benefit of IE users? Forget it.</p>

<p>Instead IE gives you a kind of &#8220;first resort&#8221; font. For IE to pick a non-Arial unicode character, you must know the correct font (a problem in itself), and it must be the <em>first in the list of alternative fonts</em>. In other words, you must have something like:</p>

<pre><code>font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Followed, By, Other, Fonts;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is fine if you want your whole document in that font. Which you probably don&#8217;t. So if you want non-Arial glyphs to display in IE, you need to apply the appropriate CSS to individual characters to select the pre-determined Windows font that supplies the glyph. Bleagh.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances I (for one) can&#8217;t even do that. I&#8217;m not sure if Wordpress officially supports the required HTML markup in the title of a post, but anyway I tried it and it doesn&#8217;t work. So even if I particularly wanted to work around the IE breakage (which I don&#8217;t) I would run slap-bang into another bug/limitation, that of Wordpress.</p>

<p>So instead I&#8217;ll just ask IE users to contact your browser vendor for a fix to this problem. Good luck!</p>

				<p>There may be another workaround, but I haven&#8217;t tested it.</p>

<p>Not for you (the web-site owner), but for the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/28/_ie_firefox/" rel="nofollow">80-odd percent</a> of the Internet users who are clueless noobs.</p>

<p>I figure if you can get an updated copy of the Arial font that includes all the relevant Unicode characters, the problem will effectively go away.</p>

<p>Then, I found that there is such a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q287247/" rel="nofollow">font already exists</a>. It is included with late versions of Microsoft Office, but it is not recommended for day-to-day use because of its size (22 MB).</p>

<p>If I could work out how to substitute that font for <code>C:\Windows\Font\Arial.ttf</code>, it would either fix this relatively trivial problem, slow down my computer immensely, or destroy my Windows installation. Hmmm, maybe I will hold off on this experiment until I have a Windows installation I don&#8217;t mind trashing. (You may insert your own cynical comment about what percentage of Windows installations that might include, right here.)</p>

				<p>Nice find, Julian.</p>

<p>The font installs as described by the knowledgebase article you pointed to. This installs an &#8220;Arial Unicode MS&#8221; font <em>in addition</em> to the standard Arial font. So I see why you would want to experiment with substituting this font for the standard Arial font: to fix IE.</p>

<p>Fortunately I can verity that merely installing this font fixes the character glyph problems (including the WHITE FROWNING FACE) in Firefox.</p>

<p>I should mention that another fix might be to install the shareware <a href="http://home.att.net/~jameskass/code2000_page.htm">Code2000</a> unicode font. This might be a more economical option than purchasing Microsoft Word if you don&#8217;t already have it.</p>

				<p>Hmm&#8230; I remember downloading Arial MS from the internets (for use in Linux, because I didn&#8217;t have enough unicode fonts), and I think it may have been on a &#8220;microsoft knowledge&#8221; type base site somewhere. Something I noticed was that Arial was by far the most complete unicode font they had (at least, it was the largest to download). I think this is why IE does the Arial trick, because it thinks of Arial MS as the &#8220;one font to rule them all&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Sunny, you may be thinking of the Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/win.htm">TrueType core fonts from the Web</a>? This included some really nice fonts, including Trebuchet and Verdana, two of my faves. It also includes Arial, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it is an earlier version. The new Arial is 22MB, whereas the one available for download is in a 500K .exe (I can&#8217;t be arsed downloading to see the extracted size, but I&#8217;m guessing less than 22MB).</p>

<p>The &#8220;one font to rule them all&#8221; idea sounds great (or at least acceptable) &#8211; if it worked. As I mentioned above, you end up with <em>both</em> Arial and Arial MS Unicode.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft no longer hosts downloads of these fonts from their site. However they are still widely available thanks to a non-restrictive license, at least that&#8217;s what it claims <a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">on the sourceforge page</a>.</p>
