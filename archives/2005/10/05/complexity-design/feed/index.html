		<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember having this argument with a creationist at Cambridge University (which is, in itself, a slightly disturbing concept). He was arguing that a Christian who denied the creationist understanding was &#039;taking glory away from God&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response was that I find it much, much more impressive to create a system with simple rules that results in an incredible universe than to just create the universe. At the time I had in mind the elegantly simple laws of physics, but the system of evolution would have been just as good an example.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Conviction radically distorts argument but argument makes little impression on conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re brave to step into this territory.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Peter, what do you mean &quot;argument&quot;? Do you mean the logical reasoning behind a conclusion, or do you mean the act of persuading someone else? I can understand that conviction distorts the latter but not necessarily the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&#039;m only biting off a small morsel, deferring to other forums for the complete discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Though I suspect you would see a greater distinction between the two than I might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it seems that implicit in your question is a perception of a platonic set of absolute truths that might be arrived at by argument (some kind of an argument convergent logical iteration - like a mathematical proof).  I kind of half believe in this, but have to admit, to being a bit of a relativist.  I think what becomes accepted as truth (even in my beloved science) is in large part the product of debate (as you say just persuading some one else - every one if you can but most people will do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I think, people who really want to believe in god (or anything else - and i don&#039;t exclude my self from this) will prefer augments (type 1 or type 2) that support their conviction.  Jesus types are keen to make room for some kind of god in a distorted arguments ranging from &#039;creation science&#039; to god some how inventing evolution or pressing a button to fire off the big bang.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There aren&#039;t that many people that can get away with quoting Time Bandits to buttress an argument. :)&lt;/p&gt;
