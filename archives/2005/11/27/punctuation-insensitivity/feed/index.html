		<description>&lt;p&gt;Alastair,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You raise some interesting points. I never would have thought to extend the argument to punctuation, but now that you have, I see it as a natural extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never considered underscore as an upper-case hyphen either. Cute idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I used a hyphen (-) when I should have used an en dash (–). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drats! I thought you had used a minus sign: 2-3 = -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the distinction between case and punctuation is fairly clear, and you touched on it above: how reliable are the transformation (or equivalence) rules?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can reliably detect equivalence between a tab character and 8 space characters in formatting code, so most programing languages ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue we can reliably detect equivalence between upper and lower case characters, so we should ignore it in more programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think general punctuation equivalence detection is (yet?) trustworthy enough to perform. So I am not calling for it (yet). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; reliable (e.g. hyphen versus en dash is a good example), then there&#039;s an argument to do some of it but the frequency of us making this distinction in a programming language seems rare, and hence low-priority. In a word-processor, on the other hand, I would argue that searching for &quot;2-3&quot; should match all the hyphen-variants; punctuation equivalence should be somewhat implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;valid for all cultures and languages&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s an ideal solution, but only one possibility. Appropriate meta-tagging of language encoding could allow language-specific rules to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I know that all this stuff is ultimately to do with programming and programming languages, but in human languages it&#039;s not the case (yeah, yeah) that capitalisation is semantically empty. A random example from a boingboing entry about the Church of Scientology&#039;s secret weirdo facility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The church offered a tour of the underground facility if KRQE would kill the piece, the station said in its newscast. Scientology also called KRQE&#039;s owner, Emmis Communications, and &quot;sought the help of a powerful New Mexican lawmaker&quot; to lobby against airing the piece, the station reported on its Web site...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if you lower-case the capital &quot;N&quot; in &quot;a powerful New Mexican lawmaker&quot;?
One is a member of the NM legislature, the other a pro wrestling contender.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I think the main problem with extending the case insensitivity argument to punctuation is that case operates at the word level, while punctuation is almost entirely grammatical: the order of complexity that your punctuation transforms need to handle (and that a human might still interpret differently) is just too high in the general case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s this complexity argument that keeps most programming languages dependent on synchronization tokens, and their compilers from automatically (for example) inserting a missing semicolon at the end of a statement, or correcting a mismatched bracket. The corrected version could be doing something completely different to what was intended, because you forgot to close a bracket, end a statement, etc. Languages like Haskell and Python have broken out of the terminator addiction through their use of semantic indenting, but they still can&#039;t go throwing extra brackets into arbitrary expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
