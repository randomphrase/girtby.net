		<description>&lt;p&gt;When I clicked the X my mind closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You Microsoft-loathing infidel!  How dare you question the holy trinity of productivity apps!  Mac OSX - do not worship false idols even if they are shiny and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mmmmm shiny and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, once upon a time we decided to look at how different document-handling applications interpret the concept of horizontal and vertical window tiling.  It was entertaining at the time - it&#039;s probably still entertaining today.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the story keeps going. I launched Microsoft Publisher on the weekend. It is another part of the Microsoft Office Suite, and it also allows multiple documents to be edited at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has a File &#124; Close menu item, it doesn&#039;t support the X icon in the top corner.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft FrontPage, of course, takes a slightly different approach. It couples the X icon more closely with the pane being edited - the X is further down the page. Perhaps this is more sensible; it suggests you are closing the pane being edited, not the pane+toolbars+menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice that, sometimes, Microsoft Publisher also offers this sort of interface, and sometimes, as mentioned in the above comment, the icon is not available at all.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Ok Here&#039;s another funny.  I am running word 2003.  I hit the close windows button, after is askes me if I want to save the document.  It closes Word all together.   But this doesn&#039;t happen all the time.  Any clue or is this just another way for Microsoft to mess with us.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Beth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it do when it &lt;em&gt;doesn&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; close Word altogether? Does it just close the document and leave an empty window?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why it happens - I don&#039;t know but I doubt that it is by design.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an awful problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use word a lot and have grown used to it&#039;s &quot;click the outer X button to close one document&quot; irregularity. Now because excel is following the rules tightly I keep closing documents without saving them first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I click the big x button and am prompted with the box &quot;Do i want to save the document?&quot; so I quickly click no but when it brings up the same prompt for the document I wanted to close I suddenly realise that it was closing all excel documents in the order that I opened them. Therefore I said I didn&#039;t want to save the document when I really did, losing all my work! Arrrrrrgh!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How difficult would it really be for microsoft to include the same MDI/SDI options they offer in applications such as Visual Studio??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please microsoft just give us the option and let us make up our own mind!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though each document is displayed in its own window, clicking on the big X on the upper right edge closes all documents and not just the current window. How strange is that?&lt;/p&gt;
