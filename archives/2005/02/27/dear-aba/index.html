		        <h3>Dear ABA 
		        </h3>
		        <p>Dear <abbr title="Australian Broadcasting Authority">ABA</abbr>,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure that by now you have received my email from last week and are busy acting on the information contained therein. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been so busy acting that you haven&#8217;t had time to even send an email requesting more information so I thought I&#8217;d share it with you anyway.</p>

<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>

<p>As you know, the story started on the 17th of February, when I received the following unsolicited email. This sort of thing usually doesn&#8217;t make it through Google&#8217;s spam filters, and I can&#8217;t say it was a pleasant surprise.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>It is forbidden. It is taboo. It is shocking.

</blockquote>

<p>So in my time I&#8217;ve seen plenty of spam. These days most of it gets filtered but enough leaks through that I get the gist of what&#8217;s out there. These days surprisingly little of it is porn, and even then the content is reasonably inoffensive, if in questionable taste. However I can&#8217;t remember having seen a piece of spam as blatant as this one about advertising child pornography.</p>

<p>This is a topic about which I have no sense of humour. Abusing children for sexual gratification is so morally repugnant that we as a society should be doing everything in our power to track down the perpetrators and &#8230; (insert revenge fantasy here). I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no need to explain more.</p>

<p>Now of course this is just one piece of spam, and the baddies are probably on the other side of the world, and it&#8217;s all probably known to the relevant authorities, and &#8230; yet maybe not. Hey, it&#8217;s the least I can do to take a few minutes to forward this spam to someone who may be able to act on the information.</p>

<p>The question is (or was): who should I forward this spam to?</p>

<p>A quick google revealed <a href="http://www.netalert.com.au/">NetAlert</a> was the &#8220;Australian Internet Safety Advisory Body&#8221; that looked at first glance like it might be able to tell me. Unfortunately not. So I emailed them, and was referred to the ABA.</p>

<p>Now as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware, part of the ABA&#8217;s charter is to administer a &#8216;co-regulatory&#8217; scheme for Internet content. Unfortunately though, &#8220;For the purposes of the regulatory scheme, Internet content does not include [...] ordinary email&#8221;.</p>

<p>[Now I'm not sure what you mean by "ordinary" email here. Does that mean you do get involved with extraordinary email? But I digress.]</p>

<p>So I emailed the helpful person at the NetAlert site who explained that my only other option was to report it to the <abbr title="Australian Communications Authority">ACA</abbr>. Unfortunately, according to <a href="http://internet.aca.gov.au/ACAINTER.12714286:STANDARD:885848750:pp=DIR2_25,pc=PC_1970#complaints%20fraudulent">their site</a>, &#8220;The Spam Act 2003, which is enforced by the ACA, covers the sending of spam messages; it does not cover the content of spam.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Multimedia/EpisodeSounds/4ACV03/">Your concept of &#8216;Internet content&#8217; confuses and infuriates us!</a> So at this point I confess to almost giving up on the whole thing. Then I hit on the idea of reporting to the ABA the URLs contained in the email rather than the entire email itself. This would mean reporting a website that I hadn&#8217;t actually visited, and had no intention to do so. And realistically, chasing down the site owners is probably the only way to investigate this incident anyway. So I hopefully did the right thing in making my complaint fit your bureaucracy. Harry Tuttle would be proud of me.</p>

<p>Please be aware I have no interest in helping you to maintain content filters. This is not the reason why I reported the sites in question to you. I am only interested in having this investigated by someone with the authority to bust a cap in the ass (or the closest legal equivalent) of the bastards who are purportedly abusing kids. After satisfying myself that <a href="http://www.aba.gov.au/internet/complaints/internet.htm#aba">child pornography matters would be referred to law enforcement</a>, I decided to go ahead with the complaint. I already had 20 minutes or so invested in this, why not a few more?</p>

<p>Off I went to your <a href="http://www.aba.gov.au/what/online/www.asp">online complaint form for web content</a>. I filled it in to the best of my ability and hit the submit button. A summary of my complaint was displayed then, and I was encouraged to print it. As I often do when dealing with important transactions online I saved the page as a PDF.</p>

<p>I sent you this PDF by email, because the online submission did not complete. Your website helpfully suggested a number of possible reasons why you couldn&#8217;t submit the form online, but unfortunately none of them were actually true. I suspect the real reason was that I used Firefox. Internet Explorer is apparently the only browser ever made, at least according to the Microsofties who coded the <abbr title="Active Server Page">ASPs</abbr> that allegedly implement the online complaint form.</p>

<p>By the way if you are too busy firing the drongos who do your website I would understand why you haven&#8217;t had time to respond to my emailed complaint form.</p>

<p>Anyway thankyou for investigating this matter. Whilst waiting for a response I will continue to labour under the illusion that this was all in some way not a total fucking waste of time.</p>

<p>Hey, at least I got to make fun of you on my blog.</p>

<p>Best wishes,
Alastair.</p>
