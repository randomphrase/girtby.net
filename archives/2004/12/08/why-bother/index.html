		        <h3>Why Bother? 
		        </h3>
		        <p>Way back when I started this humble web-log I had intended to write down exactly why I bothered to set it up. The reasons for documenting the answer to the &#8220;why bother?&#8221; question are pretty similar to the reasons for setting up the blog in the first place, namely: for my own amusement.</p>

<p>More precisely, blogging about something forces you to think &#8220;hmm, now is that really true?&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to form half-baked opinions from half-remembered factoids which you can then spout off in ordinary conversation, and get away with it. Hey, I do it all the time. Or at least I <strong>think</strong> I get away with it.</p>

<p>On the Internet, it&#8217;s not that easy to get away with it. The reasoning is: Google, archive.org, and the Internet at large, don&#8217;t seem to forget. There&#8217;s a small but non-zero chance that your idiotic spray will be preserved for all past, present and future bosses, wives, family members, co-workers, priests, plastic surgeons, therapists and insurance companies. One day one of them will come across your admission that you watch <em>Australian Idol</em> religiously, or photos of your cat&#8217;s birthday party, or your predeliction for pictures of Japanese women&#8217;s undergarments, or your too-detailed critique of the movies of Rodney Dangerfield (R.I.P.), or &#8230; do I really need to go on? (all hypothetical examples of course).</p>

<p>To me, the blog has a certain air of permanence which implies that whatever you put out there needs a bit more care than the typical throwaway comment at the dinner table. To me, this means two things: you need to think about what you blog (yeah yeah), but also you need to maintain a degree of anonymity.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the thinking and researching which is actually the fun part and the reason for blogging in the first place. Given an idea for a blog post, it&#8217;s fun to first go away and validate your original idea. It&#8217;s surprising how often your initial assumptions can be incorrect. Or maybe the situation is just more complex than originally imagined. I&#8217;ve had a few blog post ideas go on the back burner after a lot of research trying to get to the bottom of a certain topic, and failing. Hey there&#8217;s a lot more in Rodney Dangerfield&#8217;s movies than you might think.</p>

<p>The degree of anonymity that I have chosen is simply to not reveal my last name. This is just an insurance policy really. Let&#8217;s say I have too much red wine one night and rant mercilessly about the evils of, I dunno, Rupert Murdoch say. Come to think of it, that wouldn&#8217;t require much red wine. But anyway it would certainly make things awkward when in five years time I go for a job interview at News Limited, and a Google search brings my indiscretion to light. As it stands now, just about everyone reading this will know my last name anyway, and if you don&#8217;t know it, it won&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>So that partially answers the question of why I decided to leave some of my own footprints on the information superhighway. But who is going to read the bloody thing? Why not just read about stuff you&#8217;re interested in, form provocative views, and bore people at dinner parties with them, like a normal person does? I guess the short answer is that the blog hopefully provides some amusement for my friends and makes me look witty, erudite, pansophic, and .. umm &#8230; <a href="http://thesaurus.com">whatever</a>. So I don&#8217;t have any grand visions of becoming the next boingboing.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s confession time. I am vain. <strong>I like to read my own stuff.</strong> Yes it&#8217;s true, please bask in the warm glow of my ego. I confess to enjoying the occasional idle sojourn through old blog posts, particularly once you&#8217;ve forgotten about them. &#8216;S fun, like reading old emails. This is another big part of the urge to blog.</p>

<p>Lastly of course, playing around with webware is fun. It&#8217;s geek appeal that you probably either already understand or don&#8217;t give a fuck about, so I&#8217;ll shut up now.</p>

				<p>Surely you do it for my entertainment? <img src='http://girtby.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>I have to agree with your rationale.  I&#8217;m here to participate; to walk and talk in the &#8217;sphere.  I&#8217;m not here to become some seminal work for a new ways to think.</p>

<p>Playing with webware is fun.  Participation is fun.  Self-examination of what catches your interest enough to spend the effort to blog about it is <em>interesting</em>.  Winning the arms race with comment spammers for 10 minutes is invigorating.  Getting 10 emails a month from GoDaddy.com saying &#8220;if you don&#8217;t want to transfer your domain to us then don&#8217;t respond to this email&#8221; is &#8230; priceless.</p>

				<p>These are all good reasons for having a blog.  (I know, because I share them.)  They are also especially well-expressed, nearly on par with Steve Yegge&#8217;s (sorry, I forget the link to the exact post.)</p>

<p>I especially liked &#8220;I confess to enjoying the occasional idle sojourn through old blog posts &#8230;,&#8221; because I thought I was the only one who liked rereading my own old stuff.</p>

<p>One less thing to worry about!</p>
