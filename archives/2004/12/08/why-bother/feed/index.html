		<description>&lt;p&gt;Surely you do it for my entertainment? :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with your rationale.  I&#039;m here to participate; to walk and talk in the &#039;sphere.  I&#039;m not here to become some seminal work for a new ways to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing with webware is fun.  Participation is fun.  Self-examination of what catches your interest enough to spend the effort to blog about it is &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.  Winning the arms race with comment spammers for 10 minutes is invigorating.  Getting 10 emails a month from GoDaddy.com saying &quot;if you don&#039;t want to transfer your domain to us then don&#039;t respond to this email&quot; is ... priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;These are all good reasons for having a blog.  (I know, because I share them.)  They are also especially well-expressed, nearly on par with Steve Yegge&#039;s (sorry, I forget the link to the exact post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially liked &quot;I confess to enjoying the occasional idle sojourn through old blog posts ...,&quot; because I thought I was the only one who liked rereading my own old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One less thing to worry about!&lt;/p&gt;
