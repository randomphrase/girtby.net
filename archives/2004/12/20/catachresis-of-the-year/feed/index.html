		<description>&lt;p&gt;No, there was obviously glue on the guns. Or chewing gum, which he&#039;d stuck there because he needed to walk somewhere and couldn&#039;t do both at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&#039;t dignify that with catachresis, though—it&#039;s just a solecism, a misuse of &quot;literally&quot;, which happens literally &lt;strike&gt;all the time&lt;/strike&gt; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;
