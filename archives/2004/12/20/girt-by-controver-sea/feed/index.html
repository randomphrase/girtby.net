		<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time someone has a spray about &quot;girt&quot; (quite frequently in recent times due to the controversy) it puts me in mind of this inestimable blog. I too think &quot;girt&quot; is the best thing about the Nash Anth. Long live the strong verbs I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone in the SMH rather cleverly pointed out that the Anthem has been brutalised for years in the context of sporting events -- anyone who&#039;s heard Shannon Noll having a crack has to agree -- so what&#039;s wrong with giving it a bit of a reinterpretation? I&#039;ve managed to avoid hearing the new remix and am fully prepared to imaging it blowing, but that&#039;s the implementation; there&#039;s nothing wrong with the idea is there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally would like to see a Girtby remix.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Kimberley Beazley was enamoured by &quot;girt&quot; as well if I recall rightly. If I had any talent I would write a track that sounded nothing like the anthem and call it the Nemotode Remix.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Girt, Girth and Girdle are all related words and come from ME girden, OE gyrdan; c. G gürten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Beasley may be enamoured by &quot;girt&quot; but could use a girdle to girt his girth!&lt;/p&gt;
