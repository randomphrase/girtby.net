		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been coding last years in C# for the .NET platform (very good for multi-tier, business oriented apps). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, i had to write code that communicates directly with an hardware device. So i took my good&#039;ol&#039; C/C++ knownledge  and a VC++ compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to tell.. You find yourself again writing RIGHT code, THINKING rather than trying and typing. It&#039;s really a great language, even if some others aren&#039;t bad.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You are trying to sell me on C++ because I can find more interesting C++ jobs than Java jobs? Seriously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And C++ can be just as cool as Perl or Ruby? Because those languages are reducible to dynamic typing – and C++ has that! … &lt;em&gt;Seriously!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, right. Ulterior motive. I’m not on a different planet after all. Please, next time, just be honest and make it quick, OK? Insulting your readers’ intelligence is not the best way to ask something of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS.: if you spot a Haskell job, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Socrates, talk to these guys, http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial Users of FP workshop was last week, http://cufp.galois.com, and there was no shortage of industrial users.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes you are correct in all your statements. I have found that of all the interesting programming jobs, C has the most in terms of algorithmic complexity and the mathematics involved. All the mindless shovel work has been moved to C++ land. C really is a better C++ and the people who say C++ is a superset of C is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is C99 and languages built on top of that(or maybe D). Like the Vala programming language. C++ will die and be the new Cobol.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hello, I enjoyed your article a great deal. However I disagree with you that people should be learning C++. Let me tell you why that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The language feature set is too complex for most developers to master - its not enough that some people nearer the extreme end of the austism-disorder-spectrum can do that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The language spans both high level and low level programming, and low level programming is rarely needed these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The language feature set is ill-defined (have you tried to disentangle the ISO spec?), implementations often vary and language feature interaction is resolved in arbitrary ways that you cannot guess, only learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The tooling support is necessarily limited by the complexity of the language - even modern tools struggle to provide the level of finesse seen in the managed language world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Its too brittle - mistakes in C++ can and often do bring down the entire process. Mistakes in managed languages will often only bring down the current thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The performance advantages are subtle to judge and often non-existent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary let us consider a developer to have a complexity budget, that budget can be spent on the problem domain or on the language. C++ consumes too much of that budget on itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, let us thank C++ for what it has taught us about software development, let us thank James Gosling and friends for stealing ideas and discarding others, and let us thank ourselves for being wise enough to draw a line and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;No man undertakes a trade he has not learned, even the meanest; yet everyone thinks himself sufficiently qualified for the hardest of all trades, that of programming in C++. False words spoken by such men as &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot; are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil! And what is this greatest evil but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S: Thank you Don Stewart, I am once again reminded that the only thing I know is that I know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;The job issue really is a totally different one compared to Ruby or Python, really. I find the syntax of the latter a lot easier than on C++, including what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, difficult things in math will continue to be not easy, but the thing is - if you dont need superspeed or fiddle into ultimately low level, there simply is no need anymore to use C++. Just look at many games - they use C++ for the engine and often for example Lua as the glue. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Lua is easier to work with than C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the job situation differs does not mean much about the above fact.&lt;/p&gt;
