		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the heads up on eMusic... very thorough. I am also very OCD about my music meta data. If you are having issues or spending a whole lot of time finding missing album art, or artist info, I would recommend the company I work for: TuneUp. Its a software that automatically fills in art, info, and has cool features for concerts &amp; &#039;now playing&#039;. There is a free demo at www.tuneupmedia.com
Check it out and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I nearly thought this would be the answer to my needs for a good legal way to get music.
alas, this really misses a lot of the types of music i listen to and i tend to listen to a wide range of stuff. (i&#039;m a mainstream boy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;looks like i&#039;ll be waiting for amazon australia yet...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m a long-time eMusic user.  I&#039;ve really enjoyed the service, but I wholly agree with your criticisms of the eMusic web site.
As far as the helper application:  Have you tried eMusic Remote?  It&#039;s a Mozilla-based application and does add your downloads to iTunes.  IIRC, eMusic Remote is still beta, but I&#039;ve been using it for a while and it works well enough.  There&#039;s some rough edges in it though.  For example, the application takes a while, several seconds, to indicate that it has &quot;heard&quot; your download request and indicate that it has begun downloading the requested tracks.  It spite of the roughness of some features, I&#039;ve found it much prefereable to the download manager.  YMMV :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can find eMusic Remote at http://developer.emusic.com/&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;eMusic has been around for quite some time now and was perhaps one of the first online music stores. (They Might Be Giants fans might recall eMusic&#039;s exclusive release of &lt;em&gt;Long Tall Weekend&lt;/em&gt; nearly a decade ago.)  Very nice that it&#039;s grown and remained DRM-free, though.&lt;/p&gt;
