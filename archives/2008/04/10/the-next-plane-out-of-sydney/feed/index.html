		<description>&lt;p&gt;The worst part about your infrequent blogging is that my comment metadata doesn&#039;t survive the duration between posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe that&#039;s not actually the worst part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good vacation, and I look forward to future musings.  Thanks for the Stross recommendation: never heard of him and this one sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I dropped out of my high-speed, 24x7, fancy-pants, RSS aggregator to stop and smell the roses amongst the quaint rural charm of your site. I was horrified to find that the archives links with their counts that I had heard so much were nowhere to be seen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually stumbled my way to your homepage. There they are, in their full glory! Not on the individual post pages though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your trip, and congrats on the new job.&lt;/p&gt;
