		        <h3>Reality Distortion vs. Reality 
		        </h3>
		        <p>Herewith, some comments apropos of the Macworld 08 Keynote, specifically Randy Newman&#8217;s performance at the end.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Keynote as a whole seems to have moved from slick-but-reality-distorted marketing into the realms of straight-out entertainment. Apple are simply leading the pack, and I expect Microsoft and others to follow (e.g. Bill Gates&#8217;s CES keynote). At the end of the Keynote, Randy Newman sang a couple of songs and rambled (fairly incoherently I thought). Part of the monologue was related to Apple as he said that &#8220;this company&#8221; wasn&#8217;t like the others; although it was sufficiently vague that he could have been talking about Pixar instead. And aside from this one mention, Newman could have been playing a set on a late night chat show or something.</p>

<p>The convergence of entertainment with marketing is taken to an extreme in <a href="http://www.jonarmstrong.com/">Jon Armstrong</a>&#8217;s excellent and hilarious novel <cite>Grey</cite> (available for free on audio podcast from his site). Without giving away too much, in the world of <cite>Grey</cite>, corporate marketing includes &#8220;publicity dates&#8221; between members of the respective CEOs families, the resulting courtship is eagerly devoured by a gossip-hungry public, and actual information about the products or the company is completely ignored. In a similar vein, future MacWorld Keynotes could easily include dance routines from Steve Jobs&#8217; offspring. OK maybe not, but you have to wonder where it will end.</p>

<p>My second point is that the flavour of entertainment on display at the Macworld 08 show was particularly inappropriate I thought. The message came through pretty loud and clear: Randy Newman doesn&#8217;t like the Bush administration. The song <cite>A few words in defense of our country</cite> <a href="http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/a-few-words">makes the case</a> that the current US government is bad, but not as bad as it could have been, in comparison to the Roman Caesars for example (setting the bar rather low I would have thought).</p>

<p>Criticism of the Bush administration is something I obviously <a href="/archives/2006/10/19/my-list">have a lot of time for</a>. But is it suitable for a consumer product launch?</p>

<p>To those <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/01/keynote_roundup">apparently many</a> people at the launch who were pleased with Newman&#8217;s performance; please ask yourself how you would have felt if the entertainment had taken a position contrary to your own. Mark Nottingham <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/06/30/JavaOne">described</a> this exact situation a few years back. I have been in a similar situation, albeit on a smaller scale; prior to the Iraq invasion I was at a business meeting where one of the attendees made his clear pro-Bush views known, much to my discomfort.</p>

<p>Mix politics with business and you take a risk with a relatively small upside but a big downside. If your politics match mine, we are no more likely to do business together than before we knew each other&#8217;s positions. But if our politics disagree, this difference becomes a barrier that we each have to overcome in order to do business together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not arguing for censorship or anything. I&#8217;m just saying that the separation of politics and business is crucial for the success of both.</p>

				<p>Business is about making money, yes, but sometimes I think it&#8217;s wrong to &#8220;leave politics at the door&#8221;. In fact, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s even <em>possible</em>.</p>

<p>Deciding to continue doing business with someone even though you disagree with their political aims <em>is</em> a political decision: a decision to wimp out and fail to pursue your own political goals. A decision to support your political enemy because money is more important to you than your principles.</p>

<p>Mind you, I fail to live up to my own high-sounding rhetoric. <img src='http://girtby.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>I faced <a href="http://stilgherrian.com/religion/pinky_goes_to_hillsong/">an ethical dilemma</a>. I discovered that one of my clients is run by members of Hillsong Church — an organisation which worries me. Did I stop working for them? No. Or at least I haven&#8217;t yet. However I <em>have</em> turned down a project which would have been working directly with the Church&#8217;s own business interests.</p>

<p>On the other hand, can I be accused of religious discrimination? Perhaps. How would it have sounded if I said &#8220;I don&#8217;t work for Jews&#8221;?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s presumably OK to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t work for the baby-sacrificing Turnip Cult&#8221;, though, so where does one draw the line?</p>

<p>I think Apple&#8217;s greatest error in getting Randy Newman to perform is that Randy Newman is crap. Maybe it&#8217;s all because Al Gore is on Apple&#8217;s board.</p>

				<p>Yes, but that just proves my point! (I always love using that line&#8230;)</p>

<p>The ethical dilemma you face is plainly an obstacle that you have to get over in order to do business. But the key thing is this is the <em>result</em> of mixing business with politics (or religion).</p>

<p>Put it another way. You, like I, probably had no ethical dilemma walking into a Gloria Jeans to buy coffee <em>before</em> you found out they were closely bound to the Hillsong Church. Now of course it&#8217;s a different story (they worry me too). But the point is that ignorance is bliss, and in this case, conducive to doing business. The wonderful thing (yes I really think it is) about commerce is that in general you <em>don&#8217;t need to know</em> the ownership of a company in order to do business with them.</p>

<p>But as soon as I <em>know</em>, it becomes impossible to leave that knowledge &#8220;at the door&#8221;, as you put it.</p>

				<p>I understand that point entirely. But ignorance is why so many Bad Things are allowed to flourish. Perhaps I&#8217;m making the argument that we should (yes, that &#8220;should&#8221; word) be making more informed choices about who we do business with.</p>

<p>Obviously, though, all business involves compromise&#8230;</p>

<p>(I tended to avoid Gloria Jean&#8217;s before that, but that&#8217;s only because I like variety and will always choose the unknown corner café over the high-profile franchise.)</p>

<p>Next thing you know, he&#8217;ll be making self deprecating guest appearances on tribute videos designed as YouTube viral marketing, Oh hang on &#8230;. no &#8230; wait &#8230; I&#8217;m so confused &#8230;.</p>

<p>Well, what did you expect from I-Poddies?  (Not to be confused with &#8220;Gladies &amp; Poddies&#8221;, who can been seen furtively disguising their IP addresses when downloading the latest offering from their favourite ABC commie.)</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at how unsubtle Randy Newman&#8217;s effort was, but then, we in the other world have spent the last 8 years looking through the glass darkly.  They are just awaking from their slumber.  The alarm clock needs to be somewhat rauckus to cut through all the bling and whistles.</p>

<p>&#8216;LOL:  I always wondered why I never (and I mean Never) was tempted in the slightest, to sup a Latte in a GJs.  Now I know why!</p>
