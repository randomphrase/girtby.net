		<description>&lt;p&gt;Business is about making money, yes, but sometimes I think it&#039;s wrong to &quot;leave politics at the door&quot;. In fact, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s even &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding to continue doing business with someone even though you disagree with their political aims &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a political decision: a decision to wimp out and fail to pursue your own political goals. A decision to support your political enemy because money is more important to you than your principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I fail to live up to my own high-sounding rhetoric. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I faced &lt;a href=&quot;http://stilgherrian.com/religion/pinky_goes_to_hillsong/&quot;&gt;an ethical dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. I discovered that one of my clients is run by members of Hillsong Church — an organisation which worries me. Did I stop working for them? No. Or at least I haven&#039;t yet. However I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; turned down a project which would have been working directly with the Church&#039;s own business interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, can I be accused of religious discrimination? Perhaps. How would it have sounded if I said &quot;I don&#039;t work for Jews&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s presumably OK to say &quot;I don&#039;t work for the baby-sacrificing Turnip Cult&quot;, though, so where does one draw the line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Apple&#039;s greatest error in getting Randy Newman to perform is that Randy Newman is crap. Maybe it&#039;s all because Al Gore is on Apple&#039;s board.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but that just proves my point! (I always love using that line...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ethical dilemma you face is plainly an obstacle that you have to get over in order to do business. But the key thing is this is the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of mixing business with politics (or religion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it another way. You, like I, probably had no ethical dilemma walking into a Gloria Jeans to buy coffee &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you found out they were closely bound to the Hillsong Church. Now of course it&#039;s a different story (they worry me too). But the point is that ignorance is bliss, and in this case, conducive to doing business. The wonderful thing (yes I really think it is) about commerce is that in general you &lt;em&gt;don&#039;t need to know&lt;/em&gt; the ownership of a company in order to do business with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as soon as I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;, it becomes impossible to leave that knowledge &quot;at the door&quot;, as you put it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I understand that point entirely. But ignorance is why so many Bad Things are allowed to flourish. Perhaps I&#039;m making the argument that we should (yes, that &quot;should&quot; word) be making more informed choices about who we do business with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, though, all business involves compromise...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I tended to avoid Gloria Jean&#039;s before that, but that&#039;s only because I like variety and will always choose the unknown corner café over the high-profile franchise.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;straight-out entertainment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, he&#039;ll be making self deprecating guest appearances on tribute videos designed as YouTube viral marketing, Oh hang on .... no ... wait ... I&#039;m so confused ....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what did you expect from I-Poddies?  (Not to be confused with &quot;Gladies &amp; Poddies&quot;, who can been seen furtively disguising their IP addresses when downloading the latest offering from their favourite ABC commie.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rather surprised at how unsubtle Randy Newman&#039;s effort was, but then, we in the other world have spent the last 8 years looking through the glass darkly.  They are just awaking from their slumber.  The alarm clock needs to be somewhat rauckus to cut through all the bling and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I tended to avoid Gloria Jean’s before that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#039;LOL:  I always wondered why I never (and I mean Never) was tempted in the slightest, to sup a Latte in a GJs.  Now I know why!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Rules like &quot;don&#039;t mix politics and business&quot; were made to be broken, and Mac developer Daniel Jakult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/461/red-sweater-endorses-barack-obama&quot;&gt;shows how to do exactly that&lt;/a&gt;. I liked it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
