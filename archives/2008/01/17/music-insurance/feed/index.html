		<description>&lt;p&gt;Damn it, 2 minutes after publishing, I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjkeefe.blogspot.com/2008/01/line-of-day-2008-01-16.html&quot;&gt;Brendon&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; and realised that animatronic mice form a crucial loophole in my proposal. Maybe protection against animatronic mice can be arranged under supplemental cover?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty weird to come by from my RSS feed and see my name already in the comments.  Anyway ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the thinking you laid out, even if I don&#039;t buy the particular business model.  You might, however, make some use of the technology that would need to be developed for related purposes.  How about, say, a chip that could be installed in a radio that has the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can flag a song as reprehensible by pushing a button on the radio (okay, we need a chip and a human interface, but one button should do it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time a flagged song is broadcast, the radio automatically jumnps to the next one of your preset stations and/or invokes its seek function to go to the next available strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for an opt-in feature whereby the act of flagging a song is counted as a vote, uploaded to a database in the cloud, accessible by station programmers.  This could, over time, rid the airwaves of Whitney Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the animatronic mice, though, I got nothing, although if I&#039;d change my attitude on one hot-button issue here in the US, I&#039;m sure my Second Amendment rights could suggest something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, wait.  Maybe v 2.0 of TV-B-Gone could be made to work on the rodent robots?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but then you have to convince the manufacturers to put a feature in that their customers don&#039;t necessarily want. Why would I buy a radio that would allow &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to override &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; choice of music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, the rumours that this post was in fact inspired by hearing Meat Loaf&#039;s &lt;cite&gt;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&lt;/cite&gt; are ... completely true and entirely based in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t understand why you think my proposed feature allows anyone but the owner of the radio to control what is (not) played.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;OIC, you&#039;re thinking about a radio that can learn your taste in music and help to play only music that is compatible. This is certainly a useful product but it addresses a different problem to the one that I&#039;m thinking about with the insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how this one-radio-one-vote idea would change the type of music that radio stations play. I can&#039;t help thinking that the reason we got Whitney in the first place was from a significant proportion of people who genuinely like her music. I&#039;m worried by what might be called the American Idol effect, where the lowest-common-denominator rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an almost related note, I had immense fun at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enmoretheatre.com.au/events/2008/01/09/spicks-and-speck-tacular&quot;&gt;Spicks &amp; Speck-tacular&lt;/a&gt; show last week. Highly recommended if you&#039;re at all interested in music and/or a fan of the TV show. Anyway at the start of the show the presenter Adam Hills asked the crowd to sing the next line to a song. The twist was that it&#039;s a line that &lt;em&gt;isn&#039;t technically part of the song&lt;/em&gt; because it was (AFIAK anyway) never actually sung by the band. Australians should instantly recognise it: &quot;Am I ever gonna see your face again?&quot;. The entire theatre to a person erupted with the next line: &quot;No way, get fucked, fuck off&quot;. (Yes, I didn&#039;t say it made much sense did I?)  I find it amazing and amusing that this line was known so widely, way outside of the band&#039;s base of fans.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I agree that my proposed product goes about things a different way, but it does seem as though both of our ideas address the problem of unwanted bad music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the voting idea: you might be right about this not getting Whitney ouston off the airwaves -- no one ever went broke underestimating the bad taste of the American people, and I presume the same goes for your countrymen and women.  On the other hand, it does seem to me that a lot of people who listen to stations that still have &quot;and iiiiiii  will always luv uuuuuuuuuuu&quot; on heavy rotation tend to be passive listeners.  That is, they like the radio for background, and don&#039;t care specifically what&#039;s on, as long as it&#039;s not unfamiliar.  Thus, a concerted effort by a concerned minority could have a real effect on particularly objectionable songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s a hilarious story about the S &amp; S show.  I&#039;d love to have seen that.&lt;/p&gt;
