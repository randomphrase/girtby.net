		<description>&lt;p&gt;You have a small typo, you initially wrote that the probability of a false positive is P(&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&#124;N) instead of P(&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;&#124;N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, you have the solution right there. They won&#039;t just block &quot;porn&quot;, they&#039;ll block any and all &quot;objectionable contest&quot; or somesuch. In which case the effectiveness will climb up very drastically, depending on who decides what&#039;s objectionable.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;For me the opt-out provisions stop me from getting too militant about this silly policy... so long as the bandwidth performance penalty isn&#039;t shared by people opting out. I&#039;m also dismissing any reasoning that opting out will summon swarms of black helicopters to monitor my household&#039;s unfettered Internet usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the policy objective of providing a &quot;safe(r)&quot; home Internet service by default sounds a noble goal, it does seem like a terrible waste of money.  If the government subsidized ISPs to provide an opt-in filtering service to concerned parents at no additional cost I&#039;d be much happier with the relationship between the solution and the desired policy outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think arguing that false positives are a bad thing for people who don&#039;t opt-out is going to sway the debate.  Internet filtering, like security, is a place where theatre, overreach and false positives aren&#039;t necessarily seen as a bad thing.  They&#039;re perceived as a slight annoyance, yet also a valuable sign that the system will work when required.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Answer to your Xcopy problem
Use
&lt;code&gt;&quot;system(“echo F^&#124;xcopy &quot;$returnstr&quot; &quot;$mezteststr&quot; /f /s /e /i&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
Instead of
&lt;code&gt;&quot;system(“echo F&#124;xcopy &quot;$returnstr&quot; &quot;$mezteststr&quot; /f /s /e /i&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small difference but usable ;-))&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent post Alastair: there&#039;s nothing like a good application of Bayes&#039;s Theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A great analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the assumption by the government is that people &lt;strong&gt;accidentally&lt;/strong&gt; stumble across porn on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I can&#039;t remember accidentally viewing porn, however my children certainly used to see unwanted porn. They were lured there by honey-pot sites designed to attract children searching for free games and novelties, they were running Windows and as a side effect of getting the free games would get infected with a Trojan that would open unwanted pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, filtering isn&#039;t the answer, and has detrimental side effects. I wonder what the problem is that they are trying to fix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, the kids run MacOS X and use Firefox - I don&#039;t think they have any problem. The government should focus on that broadband infrastructure program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For me the opt-out provisions stop me from getting too militant about this silly policy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, you won&#039;t be able to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; opt out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colour me unimpressed, and suddenly much more politically active, on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
