		<description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent response, Alastair.  I read Schneier&#039;s essay before reading yours, and you hit every point that I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also agree with your conclusion -- vendor lock-in is enough of a problem that I&#039;m glad we have people with big megaphones talking about it, but unfortunately, too many of those megaphone-wielders exaggerate their cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons that PCs became the standard and Macs remained a niche item, but one of the most important factors was that the hardware was pretty much open on PCs from the get-go.  This allowed market forces to work, and more people opted for flexibility, which in turn spurred competition and knocked down the prices.  So, if you wanted a Mac because you appreciated its superior [fill in pet feature here], you accepted the proprietary nature of the machine as the price to pay for increased quality.  Mac had a second chance to win market share when they made the smart decision to base OS X on Unix -- I was one of many who bought a Mac in response.  Then they made a series of dumb decisions and broke a lot of the Unix goodness.  I won&#039;t buy another Mac, consequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect the same thing will happen with next-gen smart phones -- some people will stick with the iPhone because they like its snazziness, others will opt for a different phone, whether because its hackable, cheaper, supports more telco services, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Interestingly modern Intel-based macs have very minor differences to regular generic PC hardware. AFAIK the only major difference is that Apple uses &lt;acronym title=&quot;Extensible Firmware Interface&quot;&gt;EFI&lt;/acronym&gt; instead of the dinosaur-era BIOS used in most PCs. Hey, you can run XP or Linux or whatever you want on most Intel Macs. No vendor lock-in to OS X any more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear more about this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good point about the Intel processors.  But is it possible to install Windows on Apple hardware without OS X being installed first?  (I&#039;m not saying anyone would want to, of course.)  And, probably as a consequence of Apple&#039;s move to Intel, I understand it&#039;s possible to get OS X running, natively, on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for breaking Unix, I&#039;ve forgotten a lot of the specifics -- the reading I was doing a year or two ago convinced me to abandon the idea of a Unix box with a nice UI.  The things I remember include messing with the file system, messing with permission bits, making changes to Unix source code that are not given back to the community (and/or introducing bugs that no one else will be able to look at), and (related) closing down the OpenDarwin initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rixstep.com/2/20040621,00.shtml&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rixstep.com/2/2/20070718,00.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rixstep.com/2/20070608,01.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less specific, but captures the mood: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/eight_things_i_absolutely_hate.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/29/mark-pilgrims-list-o.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good links there Brendon. I absolutely agree with the rixstep articles that HFS+ is well and truly due for replacement. In fact Linus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/utter-crap-torvalds-pans-apple/2008/02/05/1202090393959.html&quot;&gt;said as much&lt;/a&gt; at LCA recently. There were many of us who were eagerly anticipating the inclusion of Sun&#039;s ZFS as the new default filesystem in Leopard, but sadly that was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t disagree with any of the criticisms in the O&#039;Reilly article either, and I would have a few to add to this list (&lt;code&gt;PT_DENY_ATTACH&lt;/code&gt;!), but neither these nor the HFS+ problems are overwhelming, particularly given the other major goodness of OS X as a whole. YMMV of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve thought a good deal about Mark Pilgrim&#039;s exodus to Ubuntu, and specifically about the freedom concerns. As I stated previously, I share these concerns, but put my main priority on need for &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2008/1/30/freedom-zero&quot;&gt;Free Data&lt;/a&gt;. As long as I can get my data out of my OS X and put it elsewhere, I don&#039;t feel the imperative to demand Free Software as well. Which is not to say I don&#039;t support Free Software; by analogy I support public transport and use it when I can, and yet I still own a car. I understand those who find this position to be a conflict of principles.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;With regard to your first claim that the iPhone lock-in is really an AT&amp;T lock-in, the contract between the two really makes it true of either. If you want to buy an iPhone, you get locked into AT&amp;T for two years. You are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; locked into the phone itself, but still are locked in to a vendor due solely to the phone&#039;s purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Andrew, thanks for the comment. I agree the contract an obstacle to switching, but surely if you pay the money you can still do it? I guess the main difference here between the iPhone and most other mobile devices on the market is that you can&#039;t buy the iPhone &quot;unlocked&quot; to a carrier, whereas you can with most of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Ignoring the iPod Touch which may approximate an unlocked iPhone for some classes of user...)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You make some interesting points, but I can&#039;t reconcile it with my intuition. The iPhone can only be used with AT&amp;T. It is &quot;locked&quot; to the vendor. Isn&#039;t that vendor lock-in? I haven&#039;t read the article, and the points you make are valid, so maybe the arguement the article was making had some issues, but I thought the iPhone would be a pretty &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; example of vendor lock in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe ipods as well, if you can&#039;t use them with any online store (or at least if it looks like Apple are trying to make it difficult for the ipod to inter-operate with other stores). The iPod would be locking you into the music vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
