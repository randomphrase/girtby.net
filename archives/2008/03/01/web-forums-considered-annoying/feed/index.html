		<description>&lt;p&gt;I too find web forums to be very annoying. It is so much harder to find useful information in web forums than it is with Usenet or even mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s another idea on how to deal with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to see Atompub-based forums take off in the future. The HTML forum UI would be a mere façade: a browser-based Atompub client talking to an Atompub service that treats all clients equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of technical merits, that would be miles ahead of NNTP… not to mention it’s &lt;em&gt;actually likely to happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good rant, Alastair.  I agree with almost every point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple of minor wrinkles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to post a lot on one forum, BloggingHeads.tv.  Before they switched from Phorum to vBulletin, the number of posts was prominently displayed next to one&#039;s uname.  Now, it still is, but it&#039;s much less obtrusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened, other people used to accuse me of posting just to boost my count, an observation which could not have been more wrong.  It got to the point where I wished the post count would go away, just so my number didn&#039;t set other people off.  I even considered starting to post with a new uname, just to stop the noise. but I finally decided that since I didn&#039;t care about my number, I shouldn&#039;t care what other people said about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, regarding BBcode or the like in place of HTML: I disagree with you; I can see the thinking behind it.  As annoying as it is to us non-malevolent commenters, it does seem a pretty good way to cut down on security holes and automated comment-spamming tools, while still preserving the desired functionality of markup and linking.  Given the state of the Web, I&#039;m happy enough to deal with it, since I do want to be able to, say, italicize, quote, and point to other URLS.  I agree with you that it would be nice if there were a more uniform syntax across platforms, but usually the more common elements are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The points where you most resonated with me were the irritations over how crummy forum search tools invariably are and how annoying it is that one can&#039;t automatically retrieve one&#039;s own content.  A clenched fist salute is all I can add here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Brendon, I don&#039;t understand your defence of the custom forum markup. How on earth is [B]..[/B] more resistant to spam and security vulnerabilities than &lt;b&gt;..&lt;/b&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All they&#039;re doing is making the markup &lt;em&gt;non-standard&lt;/em&gt; which is, at best, security-through-obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t get a lot of spam on this blog due to the obscure blogging platform I&#039;ve chosen. However, I can tell you that of the spam that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make it through the Akismet filter &#8212; which is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; anti-spam filter I use, BTW &#8212; prettymuch all of it is infested with forum-esque markup such as [URL=blah]..[/URL] and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; regular HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not saying that the forums should support the full set of HTML tags. I am saying that for each of the markup functions they choose to support, they should pick the HTML syntax over anything else. It&#039;s simple, it&#039;s common, it&#039;s well-defined, it&#039;s widely-supported.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m with you on the HTML bloat problem.  Far too little signal-to-noise, substance-to-style, content-to-presentation in many cases that make bandwidth-limited (or -expensive) access painful.  A lot of this is a failure to engineer automated HTML generation that separates CSS from XHTML.  Ban the frigging &lt;font&gt; tag for a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest, well, I don&#039;t know much about vBulletin et al. I haven&#039;t used an NNTP client for years.  Funny, isn&#039;t it?  It used to be all the rage back in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Alastair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, you might be right about the HTML vs. BBedit-style tagging.  Seems to me I long ago read an explanation of why my claim was true, but I&#039;ll be hanged if I can remember it now.  (Uh-oh ... senior moment?)&lt;/p&gt;
