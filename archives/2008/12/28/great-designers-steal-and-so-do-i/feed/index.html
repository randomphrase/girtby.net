		<description>&lt;p&gt;On a somewhat related tangent, I see that Alex King has released an updated version of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2009/03/25/wordpress-mobile-edition-30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WordPress Mobile Edition plugin&lt;/a&gt;, including handling to make clickable things finger width/height. Seems like it might be interesting to hack around with, and given that your setup is more fruit-flavoured than most in my neighbourhood, maybe you can give it a whirl on your iPhone? It&#039;d be good to know how far away your theme is from working nicely with this kind of plugin...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I had no idea my asides would be so popular. Take this &lt;a href=&quot;http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090111&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;random person on IRC&lt;/a&gt; for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;Philip`&gt; http://girtby.net/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/ is probably the first web page I&#039;ve ever seen where I&#039;d expect &lt;aside&gt; to be a useful element &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;Philip`&gt; although by &quot;useful element&quot; I just mean &quot;different way of spelling &lt;div class=&#039;aside&#039;&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather a backhanded complement I admit...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;They are indeed fixed. Thanks for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to find an example of the asides Julian was referring to, but for those reading along, your recent article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://girtby.net/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hardware hacking&lt;/a&gt; has a couple of good ones (Google Reader does not do these justice, as their layout/formatting is really quite pleasant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical look is growing on me, but I think I&#039;d still prefer some gentle colours - even if they&#039;re shades of grey!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I am totally jealous of your side-bar asides, on the lefthand side of some of your posts...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Richard: Fixed the next/prev links. Or at least I think I have. Should wordpress do this sort of thing automatically? I searched and found some very old discussions about this. Also I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://kahi.cz/wordpress/generating-prevnext-link-rel-navigational-elements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which seems to suggest it&#039;s a theme issue.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the comments everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggest you turn your brightness down a bit if it&#039;s burning you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good idea on the screenshot. Don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on with the next/prev links - more wordpress breakage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&#039;t blame wordpress for the archives page though - and will lick/split/whatever to fix them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright notice fixed to show the correct CC BY-SA license for all girtby stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It looks stark. I&#039;m not sure if I like the burning white look on my 24&quot; monitor yet. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I suggest a screenshot of the blog as it is, so that any future UI changes don&#039;t make this meta blogging completely irrelevant. This would be just like recent updates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbean.com/2008/updates/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#039;re wordpress setup has confused the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Link Widgets&lt;/a&gt; extension on my browser, and I think it&#039;s because its not finding the previous and next links (since they&#039;re not among the link header items). E.g. rather than next linking to http://girtby.net/archives/2008/12/29/software-that-goes-clunk/, it seems to want to go to http://girtby.net/archives/2008/12/29/great-designers-steal-and-so-do-i/, and that&#039;s just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: the archive page that Julian mentions has some (nasty) layout problems... which I&#039;m sure will be resolved lickety-split!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need to state the copyright date on the footer of the page? This might make it easier on future generations trying to figure out when this stuff entered/will enter the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Err yes, very elegantly minimal. Certainly no colour combinations to complain about here. And it goes with my Macbook. Gee, you think of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Nice clean look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the same instinct about fixed columns, though I have to admit I&#039;m not much of a Web designer.  Good luck keeping things fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
