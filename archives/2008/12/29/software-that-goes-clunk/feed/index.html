		<description>&lt;p&gt;At least some people agree with your view that &quot;Made with Unit Testing&quot; is a key quality indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedparser.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Universal Feed Parser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They spend a total of 12 words on their home page describing the component before giving the key links and launching into example code on how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five of those words describe what it does. Two describe the technology. Two describe the license. The other three are &quot;3000 unit tests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course they could be 3000 worthless unit tests, but they certainly give the impression that they are serious about it.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I invite you to skim through &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;all the posts for 2008 but particularly the summaries&lt;/a&gt;. :-) And &lt;a href=&quot;http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/38036&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it only gets better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, your language could do that too… but &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; it? We’ve got your test religion right here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There is no empirical evidence that unit testing is a better software quality technique when compared with other quality-inducing tools and practices (code reviews, test-after, etc).  To my recollection, given current evidence, the winner of that fight would be one of the many types of formal code review.  &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just because software is unit tested doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s unit tested well. Just because software is covered doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s covered well. This is sort of the exact problem with ISO9000 - It&#039;s more about intent, and less about a check-box. You can pay lip service to any sort of metric. Just look at Agitar!&lt;/p&gt;
