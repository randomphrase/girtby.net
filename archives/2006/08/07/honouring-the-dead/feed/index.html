		<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Civilian casualties are unacceptable in any conflict&quot; - your opinion is admirable but you might agree, one held by a minority of people in Aus today, a smaller minority in 1945 and a nonexistent one among military planners then, and now.  Not that they (military planners) didn&#039;t learn a lot about the function of nuclear weapons from the application of the U235 gun device to Hiroshima and the plutonium implosion device at Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far a honoring the dead - some might say they got what was coming to them - personally i don’t agree with that.  I certainly feel sorry for them -  honor to any brave Japanese that stood against military imperialism then, or, dare I say any American (or Australian) that does today.&lt;/p&gt;
