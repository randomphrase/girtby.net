		<description>&lt;p&gt;I had no interest in PHP, but having resolved that I must learn some PHP, I have acknowledged that every experience can teach me many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for succinctly describing some of your WordPress gripes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d really like to migrate away from Wordpress to Typo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two questions really, is there an &#039;easy&#039; way of migrating my content and comments from wordpress.com and where is the best place to host the new blog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people suggest Textdrive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your help would be most appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
