		<description>&lt;p&gt;On the subject of FLAC and iTunes it&#039;s interesting to note that FLAC is natively supported by Quicktime in the next version of OS X, currently available to developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t47526.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#039;t unfortunately mean that support will make it to Windows Quicktime, iTunes, the iTunes Store or the iPod (in roughly increasing order of unlikeliness) but you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s great news dave, well spotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though personally I would put iPod support ahead of iTunes Store support, based on past form: the Apple Lossless codec is supported in the iPod but not in the iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi!
Occasionally dropped in here searching for a good resource to download MP3. I am sorry to mention that navigation through the bleep.com is not that easy! It would look much better if it did not have those three sections of a few albums and numerous pages to flick through. Sorry for saying this, probably this is a highly convenient site for those who are used to work with it but at the first glance - I got confused in it.&lt;/p&gt;
