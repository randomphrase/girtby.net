		<description>&lt;p&gt;I will join with you in initiating requests to Apple asking for a rating system that goes up to six, and a volume control that goes to eleven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the rating I give a song is mostly defined by the way iTunes treats them.  iTunes has a few features for increasing the relative frequency of play based on rating.  IMO If the rating system were &quot;pure&quot; it would be divorced from the play frequency modifier.  There are songs that I rate very highly that I don&#039;t want to hear very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that most savvy iTunes users power-game the rating system for optimized listening frequency rather than respect it as a record of assessed quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I want to rock-out... err... Pop-out I play &quot;My Top Rated&quot; playlist.  Much of my iTunes manicure activity during my shuffled-album listening across my whole collection is when I decide to prop up the rating a song that&#039;s &quot;in favour&quot; to four or five stars so that it gets into the top rated list.  When I listen to the top rated list, I&#039;m subconsciously listening for tired old songs to drop - which I do by I dropping them down to three stars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh the fickleness of Pop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are songs that I rate very highly that I don’t want to hear very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need that rating to achieve some purpose other than having rated them, though?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you need that rating to achieve some purpose other than having rated them, though?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I understand your question correctly -- The initial reason I had for indulging myself with the iTunes&#039; rating system was vanity.  Now I use it primarily for influencing play probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you share your iTunes music collection, other people on the network can see how you&#039;ve rated your music and criticise you.  I&#039;m a fragile, lonely, and shy person who secretly yearns for opportunities to laugh in the face of people who say that Mylo&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Need You Tonight&lt;/em&gt; is better than Massive Attack&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Unfinished Sympathy&lt;/em&gt; and is therefore incorrectly rated in my music collection.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ratings are a social function or a useful administration hobby for vain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/minisites/nickhornby/books/hf_extract.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;people of a particular type&lt;/a&gt;, which I may or may not resemble.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My complaint is that iTunes overloads the rating system as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omninerd.com/2006/02/10/articles/47&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;play frequency probablity fudge&lt;/a&gt;, when I would like a different option for putting tracks on high rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Alastair just pointed out that I&#039;m delusional.  More delusional than usual.  The outcome of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omninerd.com/2005/08/25/articles/34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper is that unless I&#039;m using Party Shuffle (and I usually don&#039;t) the rating system has no effect on play probability.&lt;/p&gt;
