		        <h3>A Futile Gesture 
		        </h3>
		        <p>The great thing about blogging is that even when you perform some totally pointless task or make a futile gesture, at least you get to redeem some benefit from it by sharing with others.</p>

<p>So, in that vein let me tell you all now that I have attempted to report an email spammer to the <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.65640:LANDING:293549264:pc=ACMA,tlp=ACMA">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a>.</p>

<p><span id="more-173"></span></p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a dog. (No, wait, I&#8217;m going somewhere with this.)</p>

<p>I was going to tell you the dog&#8217;s name, because it was a bit unusual and added a bit of flavour to the story, but I&#8217;ve just realised that &#8220;what was your first pet&#8217;s name?&#8221; is a common secret question used by various institutions who want to identify you when you lose your password or PIN or whatever (despite it being a <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/the_curse_of_th.html">terrible idea</a>). So in the interests of anonymity of my now long-dead dog, let&#8217;s call her <a href="http://www.familyguyquotes.com/characters/brian-quotes.html">Brian</a>.</p>

<p>On hot days Brian used to get bugged by flies. For the most part Brian would ignore the flies because she knew that the flies were a lot quicker than she was, and so she mostly learned to live with them.</p>

<p>Every once in a while though, a fly would get close enough and she&#8217;d have a go. I won&#8217;t say how successful she was because I really wasn&#8217;t paying that much attention, and the idea of eating flies is kinda gross, even for a dog. Anyway the point is that Brian had a very highly-attuned sense of opportunity. Either the fly was close enough to catch, or it wasn&#8217;t, and the dog knew &mdash; from, it must be said, long experience &mdash; how close was close enough. She knew the fly event horizon (if you will).</p>

<p>So my attitude towards spam has been influenced by Brian&#8217;s attitude towards flies. I&#8217;ll try to ignore and deal with the spam as best I can, but when a spammer comes close enough to bite, I will.</p>

<p>Recently I started getting spam from a real estate company I&#8217;d never heard of. I don&#8217;t know where they got my email address, but it was my yahoo address, which I haven&#8217;t used in a while. Also they knew my real name, so I&#8217;m guessing they didn&#8217;t harvest it online. Given that the content (real estate in Inner Sydney) is a subject I am not entirely disinterested in, it&#8217;s possible that they may have obtained that email address through a prior business relationship. Who knows.</p>

<p>Anyway I figured they looked legitimate enough to risk the unsubscribe link provided. I entered my email address into their web form and was given a positive response: &#8220;you have been removed from our list&#8221; or similar.</p>

<p>But the spam kept coming. Not a lot, maybe one every couple of weeks. This was particularly annoying because it was an Australian company and, despite them being in the real estate business, I expected better. After unsuccessfully trying to remove myself from their mailing list, I ignored a few spam emails from them and eventually snapped. Figuring that they had strayed close enough, I pounced.</p>

<p>The ACMA has an <a href="https://web.acma.gov.au/secure/complaint_form.htm">online form for reporting spam</a>. You enter some details, and it responds with a rather uninspiring acknowledgement, and the reassurance that &#8220;you have not been added to any distribution list&#8221;.</p>

<p>Figuring that that would be the last I heard of it, I began planning the blog entry about the experience. To my surprise however, I did get an email a few days later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your recent spam complaint.</p>
  
  <p>ACMA has taken the following action with regard to your complaint:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>written to the business to allege that it has breached the Spam Act;</li>
  <li>informed the business of the financial penalties that apply for further breaches of the Act; and</li>
  <li>directed the business to ensure that all its future electronic messages comply with the Act, and immediately remove your address from its mailing lists.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe it wasn&#8217;t futile after all.</p>

<p>This blog entry dedicated to the memory of Brian. Hope you&#8217;re enjoying Doggie Heaven, where all the flies are easy to catch. And the spammers too.</p>
