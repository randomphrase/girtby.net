		<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you considered changing hosting provider, to somewhere that will give you less grief per bogomip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO you can&#039;t go past something like Linode http://www.linode.com/products/linodes.cfm US$20 a month isn&#039;t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;What do you think the root cause of this is? I guess you figure it&#039;s Typo as moving to another Ruby on Rails application might help.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@Matt: Well, US$20/month is almost 3x what I&#039;m paying now. That would make me seriously reconsider how much I&#039;m willing to pay to keep blogging. Works out to about $3-4 per article that I have to pay. Just doesn&#039;t seem worth it in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it might be OK for the short term - just to avoid the time expense of migrating back to wordpress which will, I&#039;m sure, involve PHP coding. Shudder. I&#039;d definitely pay money to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@marxy: I would like to think the root cause is Typo, mainly because it&#039;s the easiest to fix. There have been some rumblings on the Typo list about performance optimisation, particularly with the number of database queries required for apparently simple operations. So I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that Rails isn&#039;t fundamentally a resource hog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the decision to move away from Typo is more based on it being the easiest thing to do at this point in time. I don&#039;t really have the time or inclination to do a detailed performance analysis on the current Typo installation and work out where the bottlenecks are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m also putting in place another short-term fix, namely to serve the static content (eg images) from apache rather than pass the requests through to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;mongrel&lt;/a&gt; (the RoR process). I&#039;m sure this will please those folks who are currently enjoying their picture of &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2006/02/03/aesthetics&quot;&gt;Homer&#039;s car&lt;/a&gt; at my expense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;another short-term fix, namely to serve the static content (eg images) from apache rather than pass the requests through to mongrel (the RoR process)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that’s not what’s known as a short-term fix, it’s more what’s known as a good common practice. Additionally I’d look into having Apache cache the content for requests proxied to the backend app. You seem to already be doing something like that, except:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ HEAD http://girtby.net/ &#124; grep Cache
X-Cache: MISS from girtby.net
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, another problem/limitation with Typo is that it doesn&#039;t support Last-Modified or ETag headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible cause of increased CPU usage, but not so easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
