		<description>&lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to tell me – 15 duplicate new entries in both of your feeds tell the story themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone tell me why in near-2007 noone heeds Atom’s admonition to store IDs in the database along with items so that they won’t change across site moves and migrations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Aristotle, that&#039;s an excellent question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preliminary answer seems to be that Mephisto generates its own IDs based on the date published, internal database ID, and the FQDN. At first blush I&#039;d say Mephisto is broken, but that&#039;s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result there is nowhere in the database for a stable article ID. Hence although Typo uses a GUID, this is not preserved when the article comes across to Mephisto.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;PS.: sorry to be so grumpy. This is just a personal pet peeve, because it’s such a small detail for feed publishing software but has such a big effect on the feed consumer user experience. So when it works correctly it’s a good sign that the developers have done their homework… and unsurprisingly, most haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;OK, now I no longer apologise for being grumpy. I just deleted &lt;em&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;7th&lt;/strong&gt; set of fresh dupes&lt;/em&gt;! Can you please &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; fix the damn thing? It’s getting to the point that I’d rather not have to keep cleaning up the mess anymore, even though I am very reluctant to unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Aristotle,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly haven&#039;t got a clue why you are seeing so many dupes. I have deliberately not touched the live site config for days now. Also I am not seeing any dupes in my aggregator (NetNewsWire).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I&#039;ve just noticed that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;id&gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the main feed document includes the year, and hence would have just changed. Perhaps this would have caused the most recent round of dupes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The obvious point that the year should probably not be included in the feed:id is well taken. I&#039;ll raise it with the Mephisto devs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&#039;t explain the previous dupes you were getting though. I would imagine that at &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; you would have two sets of dupes, one for the Mephisto conversion, and one for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some older permalinks (specifically the /archives links) won’t work right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that! I was looking for your old &quot;Don&#039;t use Wingdings&quot; article, and Google is still pointing to broken links.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still working on a fix for the older permalinks. If you want you can change &lt;code&gt;/archives/...&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/articles/...&lt;/code&gt; and it should work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It might have been my aggregator partially at fault too, I’m no longer sure. I got &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; batch of dupes after writing that comment, but it seems to have been the last. Let’s hope.&lt;/p&gt;
