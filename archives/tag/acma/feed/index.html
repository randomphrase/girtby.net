			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately the Rudd government are pressing forward with their <a href="/archives/2008/1/3/where-s-the-mandatory-filtering-for-government-stupidity">proposal for mandatory internet filtering</a>. Recently, Electronic Frontiers Australia <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/2008/07/31/efa-says-filtering-trial-a-failure/">summarised the results</a> of an <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310554/isp-level_internet_content_filtering_trial-report.pdf">analysis of current ISP-level filters</a> commissioned by my old <a href="/archives/2006/2/10/a-futile-gesture">mates</a> at <acronym title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">ACMA</acronym>. The figures are frankly <em>begging</em> to be plugged into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes&#8217; Theorem</a>, so let&#8217;s do that.</p>

<p><span id="more-3233"></span></p>

<p>Firstly some terms. Let &#8220;P&#8221; be the event of discovering a Porn site on the internet. Let &#8220;N&#8221; be the converse event: discovering a Non-porn site. Let &#8220;+&#8221; be the event of a postive detection by an ISP filter. And obviously by &#8220;porn&#8221; I mean &#8220;inappropriate material&#8221;, the definition of which may or may not coincide with the Government&#8217;s; for the (admittedly rhetorical) purposes of this exercise it doesn&#8217;t matter too much.</p>

<p>One of the key assumptions we have to make is P(P), or the probability of discovering a porn site. Obviously this depends greatly on how hard you&#8217;re searching for it! Now I don&#8217;t know about you, but I find that I almost <em>never</em> stumble upon a porn site by accident. Almost all of my regular news sources are relatively clean, or use the NSFW tag generously. But I&#8217;m quite happy to concede that my web habits are non-representative. So let&#8217;s just assume a regular family internet connection with a moderate amount of parental supervision, with a 5% chance of accidentally stumbling on porn. This still seems quite high, but it will suffice for now.</p>

<p>To do the calculation we also need:</p>

<ul>
<li>P(N), which is pretty obviously 1 &#8211; P(P), or 0.95.</li>
<li>P(+|P) is the probability of a positive detection by the filter, given a porn site. According to the report, this varies from 87&ndash;98%. Let&#8217;s be generous and say a probability of 0.95.</li>
<li>P(+|N) is the probability of a false positive detection by the filter. Again the results vary, this time from 1.3&ndash;7.8%. Let&#8217;s use a similarly generous probability of 0.04.</li>
<li>P(+) is the probability of a positive detection given any input. This is calculated by adding P(+|P) × P(P) and P(+|N) × P(N).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now using Bayes&#8217; Theorem we can calculate P(P|+). In other words: if a filter blocks a given site, what is the probability that it was porn?</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.05 / ( 0.95 × 0.05 + 0.04 × 0.95 )
       = 0.55
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, <strong>each time the filter blocks something there is an about even chance that it wasn&#8217;t porn</strong>. In my opinion this is sufficiently damning evidence to show the worthlessness of any of these filters.</p>

<p>So obviously we made some assumptions about the prevalence of porn, and hence the probability of discovering it. If we assume the internet is 50% porn, then the filter starts to look vaguely effective:</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.5 / (0.95 × 0.5 + 0.04 × 0.5)
       = 0.96
</code></pre>

<p>But this is clearly a ridiculous assumption. If, on the other hand, we say that P(P) is lower, maybe a 1% chance of stumbling on porn &mdash; which frankly still sounds high to me &mdash; then the filters look even more useless:</p>

<pre><code>P(P|+) = P(+|P) × P(P) / P(+)
       = 0.95 × 0.01 / ( 0.95 × 0.01 + 0.04 × 0.99 )
       = 0.19
</code></pre>

<p>So if the filter is blocking something, there&#8217;s an 80% chance that it wasn&#8217;t porn! Fantastic! For some reason these calculations seem to be missing from the ACMA report.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/censorship/mandatory-isp-blocking/">EFA analysis</a> for more on the mandatory filtering, and while you&#8217;re there, join up. I have.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still in holiday mode and have not spent much time online studying the reaction to the idiotic mandatory filtering proposals from the new Rudd government, but I expect <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,22997280-15306,00.html">this editorial</a> published in the Australian is mostly representative. I disagree with none of it.</p>

<p>However I just can&#8217;t help passing further comment, mainly because there is a lengthy discussion in the <a href="/archives/2007/12/20/code-2-0">previously-mentioned Lessig book</a> which outlines what I would consider an acceptable regulatory framework for controlling access to content online. So please feel free to <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/codev2/index.cgi?free_speech">peruse it</a> for yourself (the section titled &#8220;Regulating Net-Porn&#8221; in particular), but it might be summarised as requiring publishers to rate their content in accordance with pre-existing legal standards (eg a &#8220;harmful to minors&#8221; HTML tag), which would in turn create a market for end-user filtering technology.</p>

<p>But instead of this, what are we getting? Mandatory (but perhaps a per-customer &#8216;opt-out&#8217; ability) filtering of some vaguely defined standard using not-at-all defined technology and with not-at-all defined procedures for redress of inappropriate filtering. Just like the <a href="/archives/2005/12/8/ip-access-list-100-deny-from-future">internet connection at work</a>, in other words.</p>

<p>The point that strikes me upon reading Lessig&#8217;s book is that <em>if</em> filtering is to be performed (and I reiterate the point that I am not against it) it is better that it be performed by the government, in accordance with acknowledged moral standards, with process transparency and accountability. None of these are guaranteed (nor likely) if private interests are involved in filtering our content. As Lessig says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has taken key civil rights organizations too long to recognize this private threat to free-speech values. The tradition of civil rights is focused directly on government action alone. I would be the last to say that there’s not great danger from government misbehavior. But there is also danger to free speech from private misbehavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in handing the filtering problem to the ISPs, the government is effectively absolving themselves of the responsibility to implement it as intended. ISPs will of course implement the content filtering using the cheapest solution they can find, even if the <a href="/archives/2007/4/1/i-want-a-pony-domain">false-positive rate is 99.5%</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand they could require the ISPs to block sites on <acronym title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">ACMA</acronym>&#8217;s blacklist. And we all know <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001009.html">how well</a> <em>that</em> will work, right kids? But the point is that at least with ACMA you have <a href="/archives/2006/2/10/a-futile-gesture">some recourse</a>.</p>

<p>I think that requiring government accountability is the key to ensuring an acceptable outcome. If they are serious about the problem of content finding an inappropriate audience, lets see them <em>own</em> that problem, not just outsource it to the ISPs and hope for the best.</p>
