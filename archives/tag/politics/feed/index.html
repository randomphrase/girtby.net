			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herewith, some comments apropos of the Macworld 08 Keynote, specifically Randy Newman&#8217;s performance at the end.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Keynote as a whole seems to have moved from slick-but-reality-distorted marketing into the realms of straight-out entertainment. Apple are simply leading the pack, and I expect Microsoft and others to follow (e.g. Bill Gates&#8217;s CES keynote). At the end of the Keynote, Randy Newman sang a couple of songs and rambled (fairly incoherently I thought). Part of the monologue was related to Apple as he said that &#8220;this company&#8221; wasn&#8217;t like the others; although it was sufficiently vague that he could have been talking about Pixar instead. And aside from this one mention, Newman could have been playing a set on a late night chat show or something.</p>

<p>The convergence of entertainment with marketing is taken to an extreme in <a href="http://www.jonarmstrong.com/">Jon Armstrong</a>&#8217;s excellent and hilarious novel <cite>Grey</cite> (available for free on audio podcast from his site). Without giving away too much, in the world of <cite>Grey</cite>, corporate marketing includes &#8220;publicity dates&#8221; between members of the respective CEOs families, the resulting courtship is eagerly devoured by a gossip-hungry public, and actual information about the products or the company is completely ignored. In a similar vein, future MacWorld Keynotes could easily include dance routines from Steve Jobs&#8217; offspring. OK maybe not, but you have to wonder where it will end.</p>

<p>My second point is that the flavour of entertainment on display at the Macworld 08 show was particularly inappropriate I thought. The message came through pretty loud and clear: Randy Newman doesn&#8217;t like the Bush administration. The song <cite>A few words in defense of our country</cite> <a href="http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/a-few-words">makes the case</a> that the current US government is bad, but not as bad as it could have been, in comparison to the Roman Caesars for example (setting the bar rather low I would have thought).</p>

<p>Criticism of the Bush administration is something I obviously <a href="/archives/2006/10/19/my-list">have a lot of time for</a>. But is it suitable for a consumer product launch?</p>

<p>To those <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/01/keynote_roundup">apparently many</a> people at the launch who were pleased with Newman&#8217;s performance; please ask yourself how you would have felt if the entertainment had taken a position contrary to your own. Mark Nottingham <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/06/30/JavaOne">described</a> this exact situation a few years back. I have been in a similar situation, albeit on a smaller scale; prior to the Iraq invasion I was at a business meeting where one of the attendees made his clear pro-Bush views known, much to my discomfort.</p>

<p>Mix politics with business and you take a risk with a relatively small upside but a big downside. If your politics match mine, we are no more likely to do business together than before we knew each other&#8217;s positions. But if our politics disagree, this difference becomes a barrier that we each have to overcome in order to do business together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not arguing for censorship or anything. I&#8217;m just saying that the separation of politics and business is crucial for the success of both.</p>
