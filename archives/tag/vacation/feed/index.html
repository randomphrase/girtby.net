			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over to the right &mdash; unless you are using one o&#8217; them fancypants RSS aggree-gators &mdash; are the monthly archives for girtby.net, with a count of the number of articles posted for each month. Last month there was just the one and this month isn&#8217;t looking too promising either. That&#8217;s as good a measure as any that I&#8217;ve been, well, preoccupied.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that if you see a semi-regular blogger (still not quite ready to label myself like that, but anyway) suddenly go quiet, then they have either had a baby or a new job. And so it is with great pleasure that I can announce that I am the proud parent of &#8230; a 5- and a 7-year-old, and also I have a new job!</p>

<p>I like it so far, there&#8217;s a lot of c++ coding about which I intend to blog copiously until every last remnant of a regular audience has fled for their lives. Whilst simultaneously, and endlessly, reciting the latest internet meme to jump the shark (eg &#8220;FAIL!&#8221;). Oh yes.</p>

<p>But not to worry because I promise not to drive you all away just yet &#8211; not until I have at returned from a 2 week northern hemisphere (just) vacation. Tomorrow, the family and I are on the next plane out of Sydney, and after seven flying hours we&#8217;ll be landing in Phuket. More interestingly we&#8217;re also venturing inland to a rather remote part of the country, staying in a villa about which you can read on their <a href="http://www.geckovilla.com/">excellent website</a>. In short, I&#8217;m very much looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Naturally I have some <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/10/ahem.html">reading</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28novel%29">matter</a> and some <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/ricoh-gx100.shtml">new</a> <a href="http://www.ultimateears.com/_ultimateears/products/superfi/superfi4_description.php">toys</a> to sustain me for the flight, and I will make a vague, non-committal promise to blog about one of these on my return.</p>

<p>Keep the internet warm for me while I&#8217;m gone, won&#8217;t you?</p>
