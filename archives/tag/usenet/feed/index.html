			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Specialised web forums are commonplace these days. They cover the entirety of the long tail, and are therefore indispensable for discussing obscure, and not-so-obscure, topics.</p>

<p>These days I wouldn&#8217;t consider making any serious purchase without at least a brief consulation of the relevant web forum. Technical problems with just about anything can usually be resolved with a well-crafted search through the appropriate forum. Put simply, the web forum is the basic unit of online community these days.</p>

<p>But despite their ubiquity and obvious utility they remain frustratingly limited in lots of ways. In this post I vent some of these frustrations.</p>

<p><span id="more-2694"></span></p>

<h4>In The Beginning Was &#8230;</h4>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">command line</a>. But some time after that came the Internet. And some time after that, but before the advent of the web, came Usenet. It still exists and, despite its bad reputation, is actually still worthwhile for &#8230; <a href="/archives/2004/10/5/too-legit-to-quit">certain</a> types of content.</p>

<p>The problems with Usenet have been apparent for about as long as Usenet itself. In fact, there is an entire chapter of the classic <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~daniel/unix-haters.html">Unix-Haters Handbook</a> devoted to it. For me, the problems stemmed from the fact that there was a single heirarchy of groups which needed to satisfy everyone, and ended up satisfying no one. That there should be one taxonomy for all of human discorse is an obvious falsehood. It probably came about from the single, but distributed, administration structure which underpinned all of Usenet.</p>

<p>For a while there it looked like some of these problems were going to be mitigated through the use of private News servers. This allowed use of the Usenet software and protocols, but allowed anyone to be an administrator, and hence decide on the group hierarchy, rules and policies. I remember frequenting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx">3dfx</a> News server to find the latest and greatest information about the Voodoo Rush graphics boards, back in the day.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason these did not take off. Despite commonly-available client software (such as in Outlook Express and in Netscape Navigator), private News servers did not proliferate as much as web-based forums, and so are pretty rare today. At the time I felt that web forums were a step backward, and, I still feel that private News servers are superiour to web forums in many ways, despite the latter enjoying many years of active development.</p>

<h4>Set My Data Free</h4>

<p>Well, as you <a href="/archives/2008/1/30/freedom-zero">might guess</a> my biggest problem is that of Free Data. I have never seen web forum software supporting a data export feature where I could retrieve my own posts. The most widely-deployed forum application, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin">vBulletin</a> does not, as far as I can tell anyway, support <em>any</em> form of automated interface, and is not particularly unusual in this regard.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>It should be pointed out that most blog software, including the software used to run this blog, fails the Free Data test too. There is no easy way for commenters to retrieve their comments from this blog in any well-documented format. We (blog owners) all probably need to Do Better here, particularly if we&#8217;re going to bang on about the importance of Free Data.</p></div>

<p>The best you can do currently is to search for your own posts, and manually extract the contents of each result page. This is quite unfeasible in the general case, and also it is lossy because the rendered HTML rarely matches the raw content of each post.</p>

<h4>Usability</h4>

<p>The other main problems with web fora &mdash; as currently implemented by vBulletin and equivalents, at least &mdash; concern usability. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Searching</strong> a web forum is almost aways an incredibly painful experience. The results are often presented as a list of <em>threads</em>, often with no clue as to the context of the search terms within. You generally have to search <em>again</em> within the thread to find out whether or not the original search result is even relevant. Just madness.</p></li>
<li><p>Each web forum seems to implement its own <strong>markup</strong> for posts. The result is usually a variant of HTML with square brackets instead of angle brackets and a slightly different syntax. The question &#8220;why not just use HTML?&#8221; comes to mind. The JavaScript editor widgets are generally awful and often very little help in inserting the correct markup.</p></li>
<li><p>And speaking of markup, why are forums themselves generally so <strong>HTML heavy</strong>? I&#8217;m looking at a topic index page right now which is over 100K of HTML, and yet contains only 32 topics (including a half-dozen or so of the obligatory &#8220;Sticky&#8221; threads). 100K doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but when you&#8217;re navigating back and forth all the time, it can really add up. And as for access from a mobile browser, forget it.</p></li>
<li><p>Annoying <strong>subtle differences</strong> in basic functions makes it very difficult to go from one forum to another. Do you manually subscribe to topics, or is it automatic when you reply to a thread? And how do you view new replies in subscribed topics? (On one of my regular forums it is under &#8220;Preferences&#8221;, under most others it&#8217;s &#8220;UserCP&#8221;.) Controls for common tasks are distributed seemingly at random, in accordance with the whim of the site administrator&#8217;s preferences (and usually difficult to guess).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Social Dynamics</h4>

<p>Almost invariably web forums actively promote a social hierarchy amongst the participants. It is extremely common for forums to display the post count and join date for each member next to each post. This is obviously a benefit for site administrators as it attracts participants, specifically those who care about such metrics.</p>

<p>The post count is a particularly prized visible badge of honour. People seem to go to ridiculous lengths, posting the most banal of comments, all in the name of increasing their post count. MMORPG players chasing ever higher levels exhibit similar behaviour I think, and <a href="http://www.forumwarz.com/">evidently</a> I&#8217;m not the only person to notice the similarity.</p>

<p>Of course all communication online is subject to (sometimes unpredictable) effects by the technology, and you should consult <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> about those. However I find it mildly frustrating that forums are often so polluted polluted with one-liners, non-sequiturs and other fluff all as a result of affording the participant&#8217;s post count such high visibility.</p>

<h4>Bring Back NNTP!</h4>

<p>What makes all these problems, and a myriad of other little ones I haven&#8217;t bothered mentioning, is that they were far less of a problem with the NNTP technology we used before the advent of web forums. And there&#8217;s no reason why NNTP couldn&#8217;t be reinstated.</p>

<p>In fact there are forums which provide both web and NNTP interfaces. Like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/forums/news/using.html">Adobe&#8217;s</a> for one.</p>

<p>The only downside with NNTP is that there is, as far as I understand anyway, no way to communicate to the server which posts have been read and which are still unread. This really needs to be tackled, but I&#8217;m sure the web forum vendors could get together to drive an NNTP extension in this area.</p>

<p>But maybe NNTP is too obsolete to rescue. Maybe the solution is just to kick the forum software vendors to lift their game. Either way I&#8217;m happy, actually.</p>
