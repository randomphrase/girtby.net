			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many carriers, most notably AT&amp;T, but also others such as Optus, are getting a lot of bad press for charging their subscribers extra for &#8220;tethering&#8221; their iPhones to their laptops.</p>

<p>This does seem to be blatant gouging on their part, given that bytes are bytes, and regardless of whether they are destined for a phone or a tethered laptop, the cost is the same. This criticism is warranted in my opinion.</p>

<p>Carriers may claim that tethered laptops inevitably draw more traffic from individual subscribers. But I would suggest that the incremental traffic from a tethered laptop is a <em>lot</em> lower for the iPhone than for other 3G phones. Let&#8217;s face it, the iPhone is a pretty capable standalone device, and you&#8217;ll rarely need to break out the laptop to get online. Other phones are <em>far</em> inferior at browsing the net directly, and so I&#8217;d expect that there is a correspondingly larger proportion of traffic from tethered laptops of subscribers with these phones. This makes the additional pricing seem even more unfair.</p>

<p>But not all of the hate should be directed towards the carriers.</p>

<p>I am yet to see an answer to this question: how do the carriers know which traffic originates from the iPhone itself and which from a tethered laptop? I don&#8217;t know the answer definitively but I the iPhone must mark the tethered traffic somehow. I&#8217;m guessing that it must pass through the PPP session from the laptop, instead of terminating it in the phone and NATting the traffic.</p>

<p>Regardless, it is Apple that deserves at least some of the blame here for <em>enabling</em> the carriers to detect traffic in the first place. I know of no technical reason why they needed to do this; it sounds like a purely business decision. And one they didn&#8217;t need to make; surely the carriers are all Apple&#8217;s bitches at this point?</p>

<p>Boo, carriers who charge for tethering. Boo, Apple.</p>
