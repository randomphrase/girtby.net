			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the criticism of the <a href="/archives/2008/5/22/blogging-horror">Blogging Horror article</a> was based on my insistence that knowledge of the C language is essential for all software developers. Some even said I was &#8220;bigoted&#8221; for such a viewpoint, because there are many other worthy languages out there. And there certainly are. But they are not all created equal.</p>

<p>I had tried to explain my reasons for C&#8217;s special place in my list, but maybe I was not clear, so let&#8217;s try again.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: C is <em>everywhere</em>. Recently Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/06/18/In-C">made basically the same point</a>; all the major operating systems, all the high-level language runtimes, all the databases, and all major productivity applications are written in C. And there are many other categories of software that I haven&#8217;t even mentioned, all written in C.</p>

<p>So can you as a developer choose to ignore it? Live in high-level language land for your entire career? I would say almost certainly not. High-level languages often provide abstractions that relieve you from the burden of dealing with the platform on which you&#8217;re building. Which is great, but sooner or later a crack is going to open up and the abstraction is going to leak.</p>

<p>Some day you&#8217;ll need to go spelunking into the depths of your runtime environment. Maybe you&#8217;ll need to call some other C-based API for which you don&#8217;t have a convenient wrapper in your high-level language of choice. Like, say, mmap-ing a part of a file instead of the whole thing. Or maybe you&#8217;ll just want a bit of a performance boost. And on that day, boy will you wish you knew C.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s for <em>this</em> pragmatic and entirely non-bigoted reason that I promoted C to the top of my language pantheon. If you&#8217;ve never learned C, it means you&#8217;ll never be able to delve too deeply into the foundations your programming environment and find out exactly what is happening under the surface, or to extend it in any way.</p>

<p>Of course there are many other reasons to learn C, such as those discussed in comments previously, but this is main reason why it&#8217;s on my essentials list.</p>
