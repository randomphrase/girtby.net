			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should be apparent to prettymuch anyone who reads this blog that I have lost the impetus to publish regularly. Although I still have many things to say to the internet, it seems to be getting harder and harder to find the time to put these things in a blog form that I&#8217;m happy with.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m also not happy with the concept of just abandoning the blog, as so many others seem to do. I like the idea of putting it into hibernation, where it still can be linked to and indexed in search engines, but just not active.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been working out how to do that. It&#8217;s not as easy as I expected. And, yes, worth blogging about&#8230;</p>

<p><span id="more-3900"></span></p>

<h4>&#8220;Will I Dream, Dave?&#8221;</h4>

<p>I thought I wanted something quite straightforward. Basically I was going to convert the site into static HTML by walking over it with <code>wget</code> or similar. Then find a host who could serve it up cheaply and reliably.</p>

<p>The cheap part was a requirement but also an expectation. I just thought that someone somewhere would give me some hosting space for static files that would charge about the same as my domain renewal each year. I&#8217;m not interested in paying much more than that because, well. I might as well just keep paying the hosting plan I&#8217;m on now, and keep the blog open.</p>

<p>I also wanted the new hosting to have cool URIs that don&#8217;t change. So if, for example, you&#8217;ve bookmarked my insightful not-to-be-missed 2007 post on <a href="/archives/2007/04/22/it-sure-is-feisty/">fixing Ubuntu 7.04 display problems</a>, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that I intended to make sure it serves you the same long-obsolete advice for many decades to come.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s the real trick. As I found out, keeping the URIs the same, is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<h4>wordpress.com</h4>

<p>This was the first thing I tried. wordpress.com offers free-to-inexpensive hosting and, hey, I&#8217;m already running wordpress, so it should be a snap to switch over. I&#8217;d just run the blog as-is with comments disabled and it would be just like in hibernation.</p>

<p>But then I read the fine print, and found that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to keep my current theme with its <a href="/archives/2008/12/28/great-designers-steal-and-so-do-i/#comment-2268">famous</a> hand-tuned aside formatting. Not ideal, but not a show-stopper either. Also, importing the images and other assets would require involvement from wordpress support. Bit of a pain, but liveable.</p>

<p>So as an experiment I started exporting from my blog and then importing to wordpress.com. How well did this work? Well, about as well as you can expect with software that is not designed to <a href="/archives/2008/12/29/software-that-goes-clunk/">go clunk</a>. Of course, there is no error message to determine what the problem was, nor even an obvious way to erase all the partially-imported content.</p>

<h4>Amazon S3</h4>

<p>Having resolved by this stage that I was going to convert it to a static site and host it somewhere, I soon came upon the idea of using Amazon&#8217;s S3 service. I already had an account, and it looked like a great solution. Cheap, reliable and easy. (Pick any two.)</p>

<p>There are (at least) two problems with using Amazon S3 for this task.</p>

<p>Firstly there is a technical limitation with hosting a &#8220;naked&#8221; domain (ie girtby.net with no hostname). Basically the way you create a <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/VirtualHosting.html">virtual host on S3</a> is to create a &#8220;bucket&#8221; with the same name as your host, and then create a CNAME from your domain to that bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com. The problem is that you cannot create a CNAME on the root of a domain, it has to be from a hostname within that domain (eg www.girtby.net will work, girtby.net will not).</p>

<p>So that instantly breaks my URIs, but even if I could solve that problem there&#8217;s another limitation. Basically Amazon S3 is not a full hosting environment and doesn&#8217;t provide some common web server features. Most notably it won&#8217;t serve up / using /index.html.</p>

<p>So I would end up needing my own web server which would perform this redirection. But that defeats the purpose of using Amazon S3; if I had access to a reliable web server, I&#8217;d just use that to serve up the site and be done with it.</p>

<h4>Google App Engine</h4>

<p>Yes, I was quite amazed to discover that you can use Google&#8217;s App Engine as a host for an entirely static site. This is an interesting possibility because not only is it a real hosting service, and I can develop software (maybe even a blogging engine!) to bring my site back to life, should I be so inclined.</p>

<p>The plan is almost perfect, but has one flaw. Although Google seem to have once had the ability to host from a naked domain, that ability now seems to have been <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#naked_domain">revoked</a>. Which is a bit unfortunate, as it breaks my URIs.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s really a problem, and one that I must admit I did not forsee when I started using the naked domain as the preferred domain for the blog.</p>
