  Dear Alastair Rankine, 
  
  Welcome to PayPal Australia!
  
  We are pleased to confirm that as of 2 February 2006, PayPal Australia Pty Limited is now providing the PayPal Service to you.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paypal sent me an email in Feb 2006. Here&#8217;s what they said (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Alastair Rankine, </p>
  
  <p><strong>Welcome to PayPal Australia!</strong></p>
  
  <p>We are pleased to confirm that as of 2 February 2006, PayPal Australia Pty Limited is now providing the PayPal Service to you. </p>
  
  <p>You do not need to take any action, however we do recommend that you review the updated and localised user agreement and privacy policy at a time convenient to you. </p>
  
  <p>["Tip of the Day" elided]</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>Paypal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the benefit of anyone else who received such an email, here&#8217;s my best attempt at translating it from PalSpeak into English.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Chump,</p>
  
  <p><strong>Welcome to PayPal Australia!</strong></p>
  
  <p>We are pleased to confirm that as of 2 February 2006, your PayPal account is now vaguely associated with the country of Australia, but probably not in the way you expect.</p>
  
  <p>You to not need to take any action, just prepare yourself to get fleeced when you next receive an AUD payment. Because we&#8217;ve secretly kept your &#8220;default currency&#8221; as USD, we can now charge you currency exchange fees to convert an AUD payment into USD and back again! So instead of the regular 3.4% fees, you&#8217;re now looking at upwards of 10%!</p>
  
  <p>Isn&#8217;t that great &mdash; for us? Why we chose to keep your default currency as USD is a complete mystery to you, and that&#8217;s the way we like it.</p>
  
  <p>If you don&#8217;t like this arrangement you can always choose to not use PayPal whenever you next sell something on eBay.</p>
  
  <p>Ha ha! No, of course you can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s just our little joke.</p>
  
  <p>Looking forward to fleecing you, chump.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>PayPal</p>
