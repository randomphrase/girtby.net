			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So given that the world (<a href="/archives/2006/08/14/towards-a-common-blog-export-format/">still</a>) lacks a decent common export format for blog software, you might wonder how I managed to move the collection of assorted nonsense that is girtby.net from Mephisto to Wordpress.</p>

<p>Actually, there&#8217;s a real chance you might not wonder this. But let&#8217;s press on anyway for the sake of Google and future generations.</p>

<p>All the hard work was actually done by <del datetime="2008-12-08T19:02:50+00:00">Daniel</del> Dave Murphy over at <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/03/25/thy-will-be-done-m2wppy-is-released">schwuk.com</a> who published the script and a bzr branch. Jason Morrison added MySQL support and <a href="http://jayunit.net/2008/04/16/mephisto-to-wordpress/">published</a> a diff.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes of my own and published the results. You can get either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just the <a href="/code/m2wp/m2wp.py">latest m2wp.py script</a> incorporating Jason&#8217;s and my patches, or</li>
<li>A bzr <a href="/code/m2wp">branch</a>, continuing the spirit of being all modern and distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what sort of changes did I have to make?</p>

<p>Well, Dave&#8217;s script extracted the rendered HTML into the Wordpress database. This is OK but it means you can&#8217;t go back and edit old posts in their source form (in my case, Markdown format). So to use my version of the script you need to set up your content filters in Wordpress to match those in Mephisto.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other minor changes, specifically handling NULL as well as empty content (for whatever reason I had some of these fields in my Mephisto database), and a minor formatting problem which prevented the &#8220;Read More&#8221; links from working properly.</p>

<p>Anyway that&#8217;s my version of the script, and now that that&#8217;s out of the way I can get back to procrastinating about doing anything with CSS.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So girtby.net has been a bit quiet lately. You might have assumed that $WORK or $LIFE had both gotten crazy busy. In fact they had, but that&#8217;s not the only reason why girtby.net was in stasis. There&#8217;s a story behind that, but the short version is that I&#8217;m back. Not quite the same as before, but back.</p>

<p>Now, the long version.</p>

<p>The story starts about 6 weeks ago when my hosting provider kindly decided to upgrade the server I was hosted on. I had, and still have, a shared hosting account which means that they will do things like this from time to time. Most of the time it&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>This time it was a bad thing.</p>

<p>Previously I was running my blogging software (Mephisto) on Rails 2.0.2 on Ruby 1.8.6 on CentOS 4.7. In the server migration, CentOS went to 5.2 and Ruby went to 1.8.7. Rails 2.0.2 doesn&#8217;t like Ruby 1.8.7.</p>

<p>During this time almost no one noticed that anything was awry at girtby.net, thanks to the fact that most of the site was being served directly out of the cache that Mephisto keeps/kept for performance reasons. Without any blogging software behind it, the site became a zombie. Minus the staggering gait and hunger for brains of course.</p>

<p>For the next couple of weeks in my copious spare time (which wasn&#8217;t much after $WORK and $LIFE) I was trying to get Mephisto to work with Rails 2.2 which <em>could</em> work with Ruby 1.8.7. It soon became apparent that I was about the only person on the internets that was actually trying to do such a thing. And, well, screw that.</p>

<p>So I caved. And after dallying with the Rails floozy for all this time, I went grovelling back to old faithful Wordpress. Fortunately she took me back&#8230;</p>

<p>In my ~2.5 year absence Wordpress has addressed few of the <a href="/archives/2006/08/12/on-switching-to-typo">gripes</a> that I had about it previously, but it still looks like the best blogging platform available (which includes the surrounding development ecosystem).</p>

<p>There is some more blogging software navel-gazing to come, but that&#8217;s enough for now.</p>

<p>Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me I have to get back to making this place look respectable&#8230;</p>
