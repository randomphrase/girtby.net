			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watching a recent <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1707441.htm">ABC news
report</a> on Hiroshima
Day ceremonies, I&#8217;m mildly irritated at the way that such an occasion can be
co-opted. I guess it depends on what lessons you learn from the Hiroshima
bombings.</p>

<p>Some say that Hiroshima should remind us all that civilian casualties are
unacceptable in any conflict. And the relevance to the situation in Lebanon is
all too apparent.</p>

<p>Others say that Hiroshima should first and foremost be a warning against the
dangers of nuclear weapons. The relevance to nuclear energy proposals is less
apparent.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>Another group says that Hiroshima should inspire us to
&#8220;Smash Imperialism&#8221;, as phrased on a banner clearly visible in the ABC news
story. Which is kind of an odd sentiment, because dropping the bomb on Hiroshima
<em>was</em> smashing imperialism, and I&#8217;m not sure we should be celebrating
it.</p></div>

<p>Anyway, Hiroshima obviously serves as a clear and present warning against the
dangers of nuclear weapons and the brutality of civilian casualties. But I don&#8217;t
think this should be the main lesson we Australians should be learning.</p>

<p>It is vitally important for us to remember that we were <em>complicit</em> in
Hiroshima. The blood of all those civilians is on <em>our hands</em>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all very well to wash our hands of this blood and say that the bombs were
necessary to end the war. I&#8217;m not saying that the bombs weren&#8217;t necessary, or
that it wasn&#8217;t the right decision to drop them given the facts at
hand. Historians can better judge this than I can.</p>

<p>But surely we need to face up to what we did? We call ourselves a civilised
society. If that means anything, surely it means that we take responsibility for
our actions. If we do bad, even in the pursuit of long-term good, we need to
face up to it.</p>

<p>We need to honor the dead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We need to apologise, even
if <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC1F38F93BA35757C0A963958260">America
won&#8217;t</a>.</p>

<p>Australians cannot defer total responsibility across the Pacific. Whilst it was
obviously America that ultimately made the decision to bomb, we undoubtedly
share at least some of the responsibility of this decision. Japan was our
enemy. We were fighting them in alliance with the Americans. Would Menzies have
authorised the bomb, had he been asked? I&#8217;d bet he would have.</p>

<p>The Japanese atrocities in WW2 are often mentioned in the Australian
media. Typically each story will mention the horrendous hardship endured by
Australian POWs, and the issue of Japanese apology is often mentioned. That
there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan">long
list</a>
of apologetic statements from various Japanese government figures seems only to
detract from the story of a reticent, possibly defiant, Japan.</p>

<p>But how can Australia expect an apology from Japan unless we apologise for
crimes of our own?</p>

<p>The real lesson of Hiroshima day is for Australians to wake up a finally face up
to what we did. Maybe then we can face up to what we continue to do, 60 years
later.</p>
