			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new girtby.net site design. If you&#8217;re in an aggregator, please feel free to head on over to a browser and admire the countless hours of work that I&#8217;ve put into &#8230; stealing someone else&#8217;s site design.</p>

<p>For a while now I have been in awe of Khoi Vinh&#8217;s <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Subtraction</a> blog, with its amazing and minimal black-and-white design. Since first discovering it I had intended to shamelessly copy it, if ever I decided to redesign my own blog.</p>

<p>The original plan was to follow <a href="http://madbean.com/2008/sandbox-child-theme/">Matt&#8217;s recommendation</a> and customise the Sandbox wordpress theme into some reasonable facsimile of Khoi Vinh&#8217;s site, without being too noticeably similar. While casting around for other sites to steal CSS from, I came across a wordpress theme which looked to provide most of what I wanted, so I used that instead of Sandbox. Thanks to Derek Powazek for his <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/516">DePo Clean</a> theme.</p>

<p>My version of the theme has departed slightly (or perhaps radically, depending on your point of view) from the original. Instead of a 5-column fixed layout, I&#8217;ve gone with a mostly-fluid layout. Maybe it&#8217;s the coder in me, but it just feels <em>wrong</em> hard-coding magic pixel numbers into the stylesheet&#8230;</p>

<p>The fluid layout may turn out to be a mistake, and indeed I&#8217;m already concerned about the mismatch between the columns in the footer and those in the body. By the time you read this I may have already changed my mind, and reverted to a fixed-width layout.</p>

<p>One addition I am moderately proud of is the linkroll at the bottom, which is sourced directly from <a href="http://delicious.com/girtbynet">delicious</a> via javascript and styled to match the theme of the site.</p>

<p>For the most part everything has come together nicely but I&#8217;m afraid I would be lost without the assistance of the awesome <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a>, which as you can see, enables a dilettante designer like me to butcher the creations of others with ease.</p>

<p>I have some further creative additions to the site planned, not to mention some actual content, as well. Happy 2009, folks.</p>
