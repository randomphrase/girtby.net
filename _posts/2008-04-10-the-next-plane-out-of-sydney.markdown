    The worst part about your infrequent blogging is that my comment metadata doesn't survive the duration between posts.

    Okay, maybe that's not actually the worst part.

    Have a good vacation, and I look forward to future musings.  Thanks for the Stross recommendation: never heard of him and this one sounds good.

    I dropped out of my high-speed, 24x7, fancy-pants, RSS aggregator to stop and smell the roses amongst the quaint rural charm of your site. I was horrified to find that the archives links with their counts that I had heard so much were nowhere to be seen!

    I eventually stumbled my way to your homepage. There they are, in their full glory! Not on the individual post pages though.

    Enjoy your trip, and congrats on the new job.

Over to the right &mdash; unless you are using one o' them fancypants RSS aggree-gators &mdash; are the monthly archives for girtby.net, with a count of the number of articles posted for each month. Last month there was just the one and this month isn't looking too promising either. That's as good a measure as any that I've been, well, preoccupied.

It's a pretty safe bet that if you see a semi-regular blogger (still not quite ready to label myself like that, but anyway) suddenly go quiet, then they have either had a baby or a new job. And so it is with great pleasure that I can announce that I am the proud parent of ... a 5- and a 7-year-old, and also I have a new job!

I like it so far, there's a lot of c++ coding about which I intend to blog copiously until every last remnant of a regular audience has fled for their lives. Whilst simultaneously, and endlessly, reciting the latest internet meme to jump the shark (eg "FAIL!"). Oh yes.

But not to worry because I promise not to drive you all away just yet - not until I have at returned from a 2 week northern hemisphere (just) vacation. Tomorrow, the family and I are on the next plane out of Sydney, and after seven flying hours we'll be landing in Phuket. More interestingly we're also venturing inland to a rather remote part of the country, staying in a villa about which you can read on their [excellent website](http://www.geckovilla.com/). In short, I'm very much looking forward to it.

Naturally I have some [reading](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/10/ahem.html) [matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28novel%29) and some [new](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/ricoh-gx100.shtml) [toys](http://www.ultimateears.com/_ultimateears/products/superfi/superfi4_description.php) to sustain me for the flight, and I will make a vague, non-committal promise to blog about one of these on my return.

Keep the internet warm for me while I'm gone, won't you?
