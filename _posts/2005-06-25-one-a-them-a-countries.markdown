Americans confusing Australia for Austria is a joke that just never gets old. As it turns out, now you can get the same laffs [online](http://www.plotip.com/), without even meeting an American!

There's even a map, so you can see just how obviously wrong they are.

Tracing the history of the Austr(ia,alia) confusion involves more Google [mojo](/archives/2005/06/23/im-feeling-tacit/) than I have at my command, but I did discover this rather comprehensive [history of common memes](http://web.syr.edu/~rsholmes/doctroid/firstmemes.html) on the [alt.religion.kibology newsgroup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibology), which finds a 1994 reference to a troll describing [Kylie Minogue as an Austrian](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3dukmr%2424q%40harbinger.cc.monash.edu.au). But I'm sure the joke has been around for longer than that.
