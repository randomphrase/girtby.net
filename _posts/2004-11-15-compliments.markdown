    my heart if I called her Servalan. That or let her android minions drain my blood

<img src="/images/mr-darcy.jpg" width="188" height="400" alt="Mr Darcy" class="lede"/>My wife gave me a very profound compliment the other day when she said that I reminded her of Mr Darcy from <em>Pride and Predjudice</em>. We had just been drinking lots of red wine and watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243155/">Bridget Jones' Diary</a>, so I expect she had <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112130/">Colin Firth</a> in mind. Or maybe <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032943/">Laurence Olivier</a>? I'm chuffed either way - even if he is an <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1315216,00.html">epitome of the dominant patriarchal male</a>.

In response I would just like to say that my wife, especially with her current hair colour and cut, reminds me of <a href="http://www.hermit.org/Blakes7/whoswho/ManyPhotos/Servalans.html">Servalan</a> from <em>Blake's Seven</em>. This is about the highest compliment that I can give.
