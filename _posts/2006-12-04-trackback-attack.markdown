OK, I've had it with trackbacks.

It's a good idea. You have a blog, I have a blog. I can post a comment your blog by posting on my blog and sending you a trackback. This is great because it means that I own the comment and can update/correct it in accordance with my own [ethical standards](http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2005/09/08/you-re-touch-my-comments-ill-re-touch-your-face).

The only trouble is, it's not authenticated, so it opens the door to spammers. I'm seeing that about 99.99% of trackbacks I receive are spam. And 99% of spam that I get arrives via trackback. This is in line with [what others are seeing](http://www.sixapart.com/pipermail/trackback-protocol/2006-February/000088.html).

And there's not much more that I can see to do about it. They're already being filtered with Akismet. I could add some content scanning or other heuristics but these seem fairly limited at best. I certainly can't add CAPTCHA or similar [protien-folding](http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2006/11/01/an-economist-looks-at-captcha-and-porn/) tests.

So, screw it. Bye-bye trackbacks. Come back when you've got some protection against spam.
