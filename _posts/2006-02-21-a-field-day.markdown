  Last weekend, Peter convinced me to go to the [Central Coast Amateur Radio Club Field Day](http://www.ccarc.org.au/fieldday/index.htm).

  This was a great event, providing me with a glimpse of what cyberspace looked like before the Internet. Before the personal computer even. Events like this are great, you really get a sense of the community, and of the obsession that drives the members to spend all their free time on what is, to outsiders, an incomprehensible hobby. Lots of fun.

  Some photos over the fold.

It's a rather touching sight to see the prized possessions of a radio geek on offer after their death. Looks like VK2DB had a good innings anyway. RIP mate!
