Hooray for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 1.5!

It was a completely painless upgrade experience, aided by some [consise, clear instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5) and the pre-flight that I did on my local mirror.

The new version is a very nice piece of software, and I look forward to take advantage of some of it's [new features](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2005/02/03/wordpress-15-review/) in the coming weeks and months. Fellow Wordpressers, do yaself a favour.

One of these features is the ability to mix'n'match themes for the appearance. At present you're seeing the girtby.net classic theme in all it's glory. If I can tear myself away from Half-Life 2, I'll flex my puny web design muscles and come up with something less ugly.
