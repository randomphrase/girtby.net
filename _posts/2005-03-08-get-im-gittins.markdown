<img src="/images/ross-gittins.gif" alt="Ross Gittins" width="170" height="212" class="lede"/>Via [crikey](http://www.crikey.com.au/articles/2005/03/007-0001-7085.html), check out Ross Gittins [stickin' it to The Man](http://www.smh.com.au/news/Ross-Gittins/Porkies-used-to-support-industrial-relations-reform/2005/02/13/1108229855490.html) last month, demolishing Treasurer Costello's industrial relations reform policies:

>It's possible Mr Costello spouts this economic illiteracy because he knows no better, being a barrister. But it's hard to believe Treasury would have failed to brief him adequately.
>No, it's more likely he's dreamt up his own bit of convenient bulldust in the belief it will make the nasty medicine of labour-market deregulation easier for the mug punters to swallow.

In [yesterday's column](http://www.smh.com.au/news/Ross-Gittins/Economists-just-dont-get-whats-happening/2005/03/06/1110044256334.html) Gittins describes the retaliation from Costello.

>All the nation's senior economic journalists were invited to attend a recent dinner that Mr Costello addressed at a closed Treasury conference - except me.

Ouch.

<abbr title="I Am Not An Economist">IANAE</abbr> but Gittins seems to make a reasonable, if heated, case. But the point is he is doing a great job of questioning and criticising the government the way the media is [supposed to](/archives/2004/09/29/criticism-is-good/). Credit also to the Fairfax press; my loyalty to the Herald has just ratcheted up a notch.
