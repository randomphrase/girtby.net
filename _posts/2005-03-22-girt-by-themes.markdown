Thanks to the wonders of wordpress themes, you can now steal other people's work really easily!

You are now looking at *Steam*, a Wordpress theme by [Samir M. Nassar](http://steamedpenguin.com/). Modifications by me include:

* A background image on the header. This is from a photo I took of ripples in the water at Glenelg beach in Adelaide. It has had 5 minutes of ham-fisted Photoshop butchery.
* Some colour changes to make the rest of the page more harmonious with the image. Thanks, Photoshop eye dropper.
* Some minor template tweaks to incorporate the bits I liked about the old template.
* Possibly some breakage in IE6. Looks OK in Camino, Firefox, and Safari though.

Let me know if there's any other obvious breakage.

**Update:** Turns out the IE problem [occurs when using images in the sidebar](http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=28111), and it causes the sidebar to appear below the main text. D'oh. Not sure I can be bothered fixing it for the 18% of readers (possibly a high estimate) who use IE. We'll see.
