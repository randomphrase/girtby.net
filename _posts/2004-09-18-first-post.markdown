    It's a lovely url. I know you have lots of interesting thoughts to share but if the experience of my good friend Tony who also has a <a href="http://kookaburra.typepad.com/about.html">blog</a> is anything to go by, it's hard to keep it up.

    I've registered, perhaps, ten domains over the years and if you do it all yourself you invariably get bitten by the <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0065528/">catch 22</a> of needing the DNS's set up before you register but you can't get the DNS done (by a provider) until you have the domain.

    Anyway keep going, I'll be watching via the RSS feed in Firefox.

    You forced my hand!

    I registered brainsnorkel.com - as you can see the registrar has kindly set it up to serve advertising until I get a host.

    Now to start the process of Blog-de-<a href="http://tedious-soporific.blogspot.com">sock-puppetization</a>.

  content: Radio Userland broke months ago, and I still haven't had the good eight
    hours' solid debugging time required to port all my posts to PyDS. Which I'm not
    sure is the right software to keep using, but it's the one I've spent the most
    time adding features to recently, so I've the best confidence in at least fixing
    it when it breaks.
