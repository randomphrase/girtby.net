<a href="http://www.gbmini.net/gallery/general2005/Robot1?full=1"><img src="/images/as-seen-on-the-www.jpg" alt="As Seen On The World Wide Web" width="231" height="146" class="lede"/></a>Via [motoringfile](http://www.motoringfile.com) comes news of the latest accessory for your MINI: the [official MINI transformer robot toy](http://www.gbmini.net/gallery/general2005/Robot1?full=1). Unfortunately it doesn't transform, darnit.

This is the toy version of the MINI-robot that was the subject of a brilliant [viral marketing campaign](http://motoringfile.com/2004/05/20/whats_the_deal_with_men_of_metal) last year.

What especially caught my eye is the "As Seen on The World Wide Web!" starburst on the packaging. Someone at MINI marketing has a sense of humour.
