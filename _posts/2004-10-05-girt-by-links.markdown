You may be relieved to note that I am going to try not to post to girtby.net each Cool New Link that I come across. At least, not without some incisive and worthwhile commentarry. Or a dumb joke.

Some blogs degenerate into a stream of unannotated links, and frankly it's annoying. Nine times out of ten the new link appears on slashdot the next day anyway.

There's a place for posting all the links you come across in a day, and it's called <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> (great domain name eh?).

I have set up an account and will be posting there whenever the hell I feel like it. Mostly this is for my benefit (e.g. "Hmm, where did I put that link about <a href="http://www.ironworks.com/comedy/youngone/bambi1.htm">crop rotation in the 14th century</a>?") You may be interested, in which case <a href="http://del.icio.us/girtbynet">have a look</a>.  Otherwise ... umm ... don't.

If nothing else I recommend the list of <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">popular links</a>, just to see what The Kids on The Street are linking to these days.
