<img src="/images/rightwing-blogroll.png" height="183" width="111" alt="Blogroll of right-wing websites with girtby listed" class="lede"/>Being added to someone's blogroll is usually quite a sincere form of flattery. But I just can't help but wonder if there's been a mistake of some sort here.

[Ernie Chambers](http://tecp.blogspot.com/) has me added to his blogroll of almost exclusively right-wing whackos like Instapundit, Powerline and Tim Blair. Surely Ernie can't mean to put me in with that lot? It must be a typo.

And ooh it makes me wonder. Maybe there is a right-wing politics blog which is only a typo away from girtby. It [wouldn't be the first time](http://tis.goringe.net/2005/12/16/naughty-odd/) that questionable content had come uncomfortably close.
