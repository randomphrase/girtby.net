I was sent an invitation to fill out the [MIT Weblog Survey](http://blogsurvey.media.mit.edu/). Only 5000 invitations were sent out, it must have been my lucky day.

Anyway, they asked some interesting questions, and I would expect some interesting results when they come out.

If you're a blogger, it's probably worth spending the 15 mins or so to take the survey.
