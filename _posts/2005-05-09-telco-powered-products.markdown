<img src="/images/drizzle.jpg" height="404" width="265" alt="Dr. Emil Drizzlenik PhD" class="lede"/>Stuck in a blackout? Stressed? Vibrator out of batteries, with no way to recharge?

Relax, [Mike Sandman has got you covered](http://www.sandman.com/telco.html) with his Telco Powered&#153; Vibrator! It recharges from your phone line! It glows in the dark, so it's easy to find!

Also available is a Telco Powered&#153; police scanner ("Track the Riots and Looting!"), a Telco Powered&#153; cell phone (yes really), and a Telco Powered&#153; toothbrush ("Note: please make sure water is working before attempting to brush your teeth").

These and many other products developed with the experience gained from "an" accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant by their Chief Scientist, Dr. Emil Drizzlenik PhD (pictured).

Instant classic stuff, and apparently serious. (Via [MAKE: Blog](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/05/telco_powered_p.html), who seem to think it's serious too)
