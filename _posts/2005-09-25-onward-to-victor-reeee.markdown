    You—and Peter—should be stoked to know that top cliche-wrangler David Williamson says in today's SMH that the Swannies are "not just a champion team, but a team of champions".

    Onya Swannies!

    winning and remember that 50% of football is half mental.

In a [previous post](/archives/2005/09/17/the-red-and-white-sox/) I said:

> Watching a team you support (and have supported for some time despite a long losing streak) play in the premier competition of that sport is the most rewarding and exciting experience you can hope for as a spectator.

To which I should have added that your team [**winning** the premier competition for the first time in 72 years](http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/swans-grab-flag/2005/09/24/1126982272436.html) is even more exciting.

1000 kilometers away from the huge crowd at the MGC was at least one backyard gathering of Sydneysiders, all of whom went absolutely nuts in the final quarter as the Swans and Eagles tussled. And in the final seconds, "Leaping" Leo Barry leaped like he had never leaped before, to take the mark that clinched the game for Sydney. Just amazing.

Onya Swannies!
