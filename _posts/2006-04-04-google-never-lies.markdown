  content: <p>Frankly, I'm amazed at the stuff people google for. For the last few
    months the top search terms at girtby.net have been "itunes import mp3" or similar.
    But prior to that it was "fluffy bunnies", presumably as a result of <a href="/archives/2004/09/30/fluffy-bunny-act/">this</a>
    post. In fact, I think I was in the top 10 of google results for that query.

Wow. You don't get more authoritative than Google. Number one hit, no less!
