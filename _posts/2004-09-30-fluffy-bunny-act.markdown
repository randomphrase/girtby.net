Ladies and Gentlemen of the House,

Allow me to introduce HR10, the Protection of Fluffy Bunnies Act of 2004.

This Bill will ensure the protection of fluffy bunnies in this Great Nation Of Ours. No longer will their fur get all matted and yucky. And their cosy cubby houses will be henceforth nice and snuggly-wuggly.

Oh, and we also <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2004/09/legalizing_tort.html">legalised torture</a>.

I commend the Bill to the House.
