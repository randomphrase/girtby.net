Here is section 3.1 of the Usual Terms and Conditions (UTC) for Consumer Mortgage Lending, from the Commonwealth Bank:

> If the Security is not in existence at the date of the Contract, you agree to give us the Security.

I *think* this is mostly in reference to properties that are bought off the plan &mdash; when it's built it becomes property of the bank &mdash; but they sure have a funny way of putting it.
