    <p>What will be in the alastr api? Can you also offer XML-RPC and even simple HTTP Get interfaces, I always seem to have trouble with interop doing SOAP.</p>

    <p>Your pie chart reminds me of one from Dave Barry's book called "Claw your way to the top". I think it was captioned something about probability of Dave's desk catching fire.</p>

I would like to announce that as of today I am changing my name to <span style="color: #FF0084">alast</span><span style="color: blue">r</span> in order to be fully Web 2.0-compliant.

The term Web 2.0 certainly <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/11/there_has_been_.html">describes something or other</a>. The importance of Web 2.0 compliance can be illustrated by this graph.

<img src="/images/web20graph.png" width="600" height="463" alt="Amusing pie chart of Web 2.0 vs. not-Web 2.0" class="centered"/>

Clear yet? No, me neither. But I have great hopes for the Web 2.0.1 bugfix release.

[BTW That graph was stolen from the del.icio.us blog entry linked above. Intellectual Property law is so000 Web 1.0.]
