The man behind me was trying to amuse his kid by singing along with the muzak. Wang Chung's <em>Dance Hall Days</em>, or some equally crappy cover thereof. The kid was nonplused.

To make it worse, he <a href="http://www.amiright.com/misheard/artist/wangchung.shtml">didn't really know the words</a>.

To make him stop singing I had to engage him in conversation. It was either that or join in.
