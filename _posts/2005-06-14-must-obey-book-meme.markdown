For some unknown reason, [Chris is interested in what books I read](http://tis.goringe.net/2005/06/13/book-meme/).

#### Number of Books Owned?

Umm, I guess about 300-400. In two overseas moves we've managed to shed a lot of them.

#### Last Book Bought?

I hate to say it, but probably the [CCNA Study Guide](/archives/2005/06/09/hard-questions/). OK that's lame, I admit it. The last *mook* I bought was [Make 02](http://www.makezine.com/02/) - does that count?

#### Last Book Read?

<cite>There's a Wocket In My Pocket</cite>, by Dr. Seuss. A rollicking rollercoaster of a read, but a bit harsh on noothgrushes who sit on toothbrushes.

Other than this, see above.

#### Five Books That Mean a Lot To You?

The interesting question. Here we go:

 * <cite>The Blind Watchmaker</cite> by Richard Dawkins. Until reading this book, I never really *got* evolutionary biology. Dawkins explains it using an analogy that I can identify with, namely software algorithms. Now I feel enlightened.
 * <cite>GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</cite> by Douglas Hofstadter. HOWTO: develop a love of mathematics.
 * <cite>Gravity's Rainbow</cite> by Thomas Pynchon. My token effort at *real literature*. One day I will finish it. In the meantime I will bask in it's awesome density, humour, and insight.
 * <cite>Catch-22</cite> by Joesph Heller. Regular re-readings of this keep me sane.
 * <cite>The Demon-Haunted World</cite> by Carl Sagan. Great words from a great man, who was able to reconcile a strictly rational outlook on nature without losing any of its wonder.

#### Tag Five People To Continue The Meme

Minor problem: I don't know that many bloggers. [Garth](http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com) and [Matt](http://mattrubinstein.com.au), I have a [great business opportunity for you](http://www.ex-cult.org/#amway)!
