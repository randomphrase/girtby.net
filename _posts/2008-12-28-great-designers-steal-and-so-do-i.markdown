    <p>Looks good, Alastair. Elegant.</p>

    <p>I like that you have taken some inspiration from <a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2006/01/19/the-absurdly-simple-email-client/" rel="nofollow">my email client</a>. If you select <a href="http://girtby.net/archives/" rel="nofollow">View All Archives</a>, you get a 404 page - which happens to display a list of all the archives...</p>

    <p>Nice clean look.</p>

    <p>I have the same instinct about fixed columns, though I have to admit I'm not much of a Web designer.  Good luck keeping things fluid.</p>

    <p>Err yes, very elegantly minimal. Certainly no colour combinations to complain about here. And it goes with my Macbook. Gee, you think of everything.</p>

    <p>It looks stark. I'm not sure if I like the burning white look on my 24" monitor yet. We shall see.</p>

    <p>Can I suggest a screenshot of the blog as it is, so that any future UI changes don't make this meta blogging completely irrelevant. This would be just like recent updates in <a href="http://madbean.com/2008/updates/" rel="nofollow">the neighborhood</a>.</p>

    <p>You're wordpress setup has confused the Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933" rel="nofollow">Link Widgets</a> extension on my browser, and I think it's because its not finding the previous and next links (since they're not among the link header items). E.g. rather than next linking to http://girtby.net/archives/2008/12/29/software-that-goes-clunk/, it seems to want to go to http://girtby.net/archives/2008/12/29/great-designers-steal-and-so-do-i/, and that's just wrong.</p>

    <p>Also: the archive page that Julian mentions has some (nasty) layout problems... which I'm sure will be resolved lickety-split!</p>

    <p>Do you need to state the copyright date on the footer of the page? This might make it easier on future generations trying to figure out when this stuff entered/will enter the public domain.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the comments everyone.</p>

    <p>Richard:</p>

    <p>Suggest you turn your brightness down a bit if it's burning you!</p>

    <p>Good idea on the screenshot. Don't know what's going on with the next/prev links - more wordpress breakage?</p>

    <p>I won't blame wordpress for the archives page though - and will lick/split/whatever to fix them ASAP.</p>

    <p>Copyright notice fixed to show the correct CC BY-SA license for all girtby stuff.</p>

    <p>Richard: Fixed the next/prev links. Or at least I think I have. Should wordpress do this sort of thing automatically? I searched and found some very old discussions about this. Also I found <a href="http://kahi.cz/wordpress/generating-prevnext-link-rel-navigational-elements/" rel="nofollow">this</a> which seems to suggest it's a theme issue.</p>

    <p>Thanks Julian, appreciated. They're quite easy really:</p>

    <pre><code>.aside {
        float:left;
        width: 152px;
        font-size: 12px;
        margin-left: -177px;
        margin-top: -18px;
        padding-top: 18px;
        border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
        margin-bottom: 18px;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>They are indeed fixed. Thanks for that!</p>

    <p>It took me a while to find an example of the asides Julian was referring to, but for those reading along, your recent article on <a href="http://girtby.net/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/" rel="nofollow">hardware hacking</a> has a couple of good ones (Google Reader does not do these justice, as their layout/formatting is really quite pleasant).</p>

    <p>The clinical look is growing on me, but I think I'd still prefer some gentle colours - even if they're shades of grey!</p>

    <p>Wow, I had no idea my asides would be so popular. Take this <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090111" rel="nofollow">random person on IRC</a> for instance:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;Philip`&gt; http://girtby.net/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/ is probably the first web page I've ever seen where I'd expect &lt;aside&gt; to be a useful element <br />
      &lt;Philip`&gt; although by "useful element" I just mean "different way of spelling &lt;div class='aside'&gt;" </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Rather a backhanded complement I admit...</p>

    <p>On a somewhat related tangent, I see that Alex King has released an updated version of his <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2009/03/25/wordpress-mobile-edition-30" rel="nofollow">WordPress Mobile Edition plugin</a>, including handling to make clickable things finger width/height. Seems like it might be interesting to hack around with, and given that your setup is more fruit-flavoured than most in my neighbourhood, maybe you can give it a whirl on your iPhone? It'd be good to know how far away your theme is from working nicely with this kind of plugin...</p>

Welcome to the new girtby.net site design. If you're in an aggregator, please feel free to head on over to a browser and admire the countless hours of work that I've put into ... stealing someone else's site design.

For a while now I have been in awe of Khoi Vinh's [Subtraction](http://www.subtraction.com/) blog, with its amazing and minimal black-and-white design. Since first discovering it I had intended to shamelessly copy it, if ever I decided to redesign my own blog.

The original plan was to follow [Matt's recommendation](http://madbean.com/2008/sandbox-child-theme/) and customise the Sandbox wordpress theme into some reasonable facsimile of Khoi Vinh's site, without being too noticeably similar. While casting around for other sites to steal CSS from, I came across a wordpress theme which looked to provide most of what I wanted, so I used that instead of Sandbox. Thanks to Derek Powazek for his [DePo Clean](http://powazek.com/posts/516) theme.

My version of the theme has departed slightly (or perhaps radically, depending on your point of view) from the original. Instead of a 5-column fixed layout, I've gone with a mostly-fluid layout. Maybe it's the coder in me, but it just feels *wrong* hard-coding magic pixel numbers into the stylesheet...

The fluid layout may turn out to be a mistake, and indeed I'm already concerned about the mismatch between the columns in the footer and those in the body. By the time you read this I may have already changed my mind, and reverted to a fixed-width layout.

One addition I am moderately proud of is the linkroll at the bottom, which is sourced directly from [delicious](http://delicious.com/girtbynet) via javascript and styled to match the theme of the site.

For the most part everything has come together nicely but I'm afraid I would be lost without the assistance of the awesome [CSSEdit](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/), which as you can see, enables a dilettante designer like me to butcher the creations of others with ease.

I have some further creative additions to the site planned, not to mention some actual content, as well. Happy 2009, folks.
