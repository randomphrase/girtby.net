    It seems perfectly clear to me. You just need to go back to definitions.

    What is C++? The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/C/C++.html">Jargon File</a> defines it as "Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Labs as a successor to C. "

    What is the number 2? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_postulates">Peano</a> defined it as the successor to 1.

    Ergo, Cis to C++ as 1 is to 2.

    Q.E.D.

    Do I get the job?

    Nicely done, except it probably should be the other way around. C99 is the most recent standardisation of C, dating back to 1999 (obviously). C++ was ratified as a standard in 1998.

    Hence, C : C++ :: 2 : 1

    And don't call us, we'll call you.

    I think you just treat C as a regular variable, which means the expression C++ evaluates to 2.  (You would of course soundly thrash any programmer who defined a variable using a capital letter.)

    By this incremental reasoning, answer (c) is also correct, since any computer geek worth hiring looks at "10" and says "two."

    No it doesn't! If C is 1, then C++ evaluates to 1 also. ++C evaluates to 2.

    I'm sorry, the position has been filled!

    I agree that in the expression "C++," if C is referenced, it returns the value 1 before incrementing C.  But the entire expression evaluates to 2; else the following would never end:

      for (C=1; C<=10; C++) { ... }

    Another way to say it:  What's the output of this?

    int main()
    {
      int C = 1;
      while (C++ < 3) {
        printf("%d\n", C);
      }
      return 0;
    }

    I'd take a leaf from the new series of Doctor Who, where they occasionally travel to the year five billion when numbers are augmented by other symbols -- so the episode The End Of The World happens in the year 5.5/Apple/26.  So I'd say that C++ is a partial superset of C with some incompatibilities, and therefore C is to C++ as 1 is to 1.943turnip7442gorilla04.

    Do I win?

  content: Sorry folks, but unlike you nerds, computers think in BINARY, not decimal.  The
    binary representation for what you call "2" is "10".  So the correct answer is
    c) "10".

Question #24 in the otherwise quite reasonable [C/C++ programming quiz](http://www.cprogramming.com/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi) at Cprogramming.com is as follows:

> C is to C++ as 1 is to
>
> a) What the heck?
> b) 2
> c) 10

I think I have a new favourite interview question.

Anyway, have a guess what they give as an answer.

That's right, b).

Apparently they think C is almost a strict subset of C++, in exactly the same way that 1 is almost a strict subset of 2.
