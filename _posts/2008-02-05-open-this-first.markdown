    Very, very funny.

    I must admit, it was hard to open that weird Vista plastic case - presumably they were trying to be hip.

    Have been watching all the MacBook Air unboxing videos so I don't make a mistake lifting the one tab and accidentally drop it on the floor. (Although presumably it would float down light a feather).

To justify my occasional lapses into Apple fanboy-ism, I offer the following for your consideration.

[Exhibit A](http://flickr.com/photos/dansays/sets/72157603835099525/): Apple, 24 years ago

[Exhibit B](http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2e680b8d-211e-41c5-a0bf-9ccc6d7e62a21033.mspx): Microsoft, today

Yeah, I know, who cares about packaging? But howcome so few companies get it right?

And in the long run, I think it *is* important. The message you send with the packaging of your product is one of the care you have put in to producing it. And of the importance of the customer's time in getting up and running quickly.

Message received, Apple.
