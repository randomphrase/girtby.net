    Quit loitering and bid!

    I was going to make it a condition of sale that the buyer had to agree not to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Online-gamer-killed-for-selling-virtual-weapon/2005/03/30/1111862440188.html?oneclick=true" rel="nofollow">murder anyone in revenge for virtual theft</a> but that would detract from the generally positive tone of the listing :D

Behind the scenes at Chez Girtby, I have been eBaying a huge swag of stuff. This prompted [Chris](http://brainsnorkel.com/2005/04/07/buy-my-stuff/) to put his copy of Everquest 2 up for sale. The [listing](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=8183526846&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT) deserves to be preserved for posterity:

> EQ2 is set in a parallel revenue stream to EQ1 and 500 years in
> the pastfuture (of EQ1). I haven't played it so I don't know
> if (like EQ1) you can pickpocket the beaks from birds, if snakes
> still kick, or if bats that seem to have 2 wings sometimes drop 3
> - that's all part of the adventure!
>
> For around US$14.99/month you can slay rats, bats, snakes, order

I look forward to the availability of massively multiplayer online Frogger. And DirectX 18 for that matter.
