    your values in order to save them. I suggest  studying "A Few Good Men" if you
    are having trouble with this concept.</p>

    <p>There's a lot that's been said (over talk-back radio) that's pretty infuriating (or hilarious, depending on how you listen). "I wear broad shorts too, I think I should have a right to use this beach." or "A lot of these people, 'lebs' for want of a better word, claim they were born in this country, so they have as much right to use the beach as anyone else." I like someone who wrote into "Sunrise" with "If we peeled off our flesh we'd all be the same underneath."</p>

    <p>If I met the last guy on the street, I don't know if I'd rather he were racist.</p>

I appreciate that tensions are high in Sydney right now and it is important to maintain a cool head. However, statements like [this](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pm-refuses-to-use-racist-tag/2005/12/12/1134235985480.html) just infuriate me.

> "I do not accept there is underlying racism in this country," Mr Howard said today following yesterday's race riots at Cronulla Beach.

The Herald seems to be having a not-so-subtle dig at the PM here, basically contradicting him within the span of a single sentence.

Seriously, after this weekend's events, what more evidence *could there be* of Australia's underlying racism?

Other than the fact we elected John Howard, that is.
