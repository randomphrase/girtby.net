  content: Triple J also has podcasts. Notably Hack, which I've only heard once, but
    it sounds like an interesting program.

    National broadcasters, like the ABC, CBC, BBC etc are funded to make program content. Just how that content gets delivered to the customers is really irrelivent except that they should choose the most economical and convenient channels.

    These days, as one who carries a digital music player with me everywhere, tuning in on AM radio is not the main way I'd like to get content.

    The only exception is for listening to the latest news.

    Thanks to Girtby for publicising this survey.

  content: I heard on the Late night live podcast yesterday that they have 8,000 subscribers.
    They see that as an amazing early uptake for a new broadcast method.

The <abbr title="Australian Broadcasting Commission, a.k.a. Aunty">ABC</abbr> are conducting a [survey and trial of podcasting](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/) their Radio National programs. This is definitely worth getting behind. I am a big fan of Radio National and am looking forward to listening to the broadcasts through my iPod.

Thankfully it seems the ABC are sticking with the MP3 format and not WMV or Real, as they have done on other internet projects. Also it doesn't seem like they are proposing any DRM restrictions. Which is great.
