    <p>Phew. If you're like me you might have ended up with something like <a href="http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2007/12/ikea-gorm-art.html" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>

<a href="http://girtby.net/assets/2009/05/garage-shelves.jpg"><img src="http://girtby.net/assets/2009/05/garage-shelves-199x300.jpg" alt="Garage Shelves" title="garage-shelves" width="199" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-3883 lede" /></a>There's a kind of internally-generated tension that builds up when you haven't blogged for a while. It's not as bad as that other kind of tension which builds up over time, but it's still there in the back of your mind. And after a while you need to do something, anything, to release the tension.

So this is what I'm reduced to. Blogging about shelves that I put up last weekend. Yes, shelves.

Those skilled in the art of home ownership will recognise instantly these as Ikea Gorm. But look closely, see how they wrap around the down-pipe? Remember I'm [not](/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/) a hardware guy. So I'm quite proud of myself for cutting one of the planks in each shelf and using the off-cut to bind it to it's neighbour. Bit of a hack, but I defy you carpenters to come up with a better solution.

Another thing to note is that only suckers put together furniture with an allen key. Power drills FTW.
