    Alastair:

    I just took a quick look, and Amazon has a little utility that should address the annoyances with one-click that you mentioned.  See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/amd.html/ref=dm_dp_amd/104-4098833-5779113">here</a>.

    How much are you going to pay for the new Radiohead album?

    Brendan, I have been using the Amazon downloader. It's very nice, but doesn't solve the one-song one-purchase problem.

    For the Radiohead album, lacking any other guidance I will probably pay US$10, which is basically what I pay for downloaded music these days from places like Amazon and bleep.com.

Amazon recently opened their [MP3 store](http://amazonmp3.com) (in "beta" of course). It is awesome.

I don't know about you, but I certainly didn't see it coming. Previous Amazon efforts with downloaded content were pretty lame, and I had no idea that they were going to come back with an offering that was as good as this.

Although I am a [very happy bleep.com customer](/archives/2006/11/5/its-bleeping-good), their selection of music is limited to the Warp label plus a couple of degrees of separation. So I've been looking around at other DRM-free music stores, but few have excited me enough to become customers.

Amazon's catalogue of music is quite large and hopefully getting larger. Most importantly, they have an extensive back-catalogue into which I have been delving in my quest to [go legit](/archives/2004/10/5/too-legit-to-quit), and to reclaim old legitimately-purchased albums that have got lost along the way. The purchase and download process is very easy and efficient.

I can also get individual songs from those long-lost albums. Somehow though I managed to turn on the infamous one-click purchase, so rather than bundling up a bunch of individual tracks and purchasing them en masse, Amazon conducts a separate transaction for each one. But no matter.

So if you have a US credit card, do yourself a favour and check it out. This, plus the new Radiohead release, make me think we've finally reached the point where purchasing legitimate DRM-free music is easier than stealing it.
