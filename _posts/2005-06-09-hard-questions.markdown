Reading the [CCNA Study Guide, 4th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0782143113/qid=1118298780/sr=8-3/ref=pd_csp_3/102-1867699-3922541?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) I came across the following. It is the answer to a multiple choice review question. (edited and emphasis added)

>[...], so option A is wrong. [...], option B is wrong. [...], so option C is correct. [...], so option E is correct. [...], so option F is incorrect. This leaves option D, which must be correct, **but doesnâ€™t make much sense**.

Which is *exactly what I was thinking* when I saw option D.

Just for the record, option D said "If your design is hierarchical, then you don't need multiple [OSPF] areas."

They rephrased it slightly for the [5th edition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0782143911/qid=1118298780/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-1867699-3922541?v=glance&s=books&n=507846):

>This leaves option D, which must be correct; it doesn't make much sense, but it is the best answer.

So just remember, when you're studying hard and you think something doesn't make sense, maybe it's not supposed to!
