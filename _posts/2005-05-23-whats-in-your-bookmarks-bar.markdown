<img src="/images/toolbar-bookmarks.jpg" height="91" width="259" alt="Toolbar Bookmarks" class="lede" />So [apparently](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/i/my-google.png) I'm not the only one who fills up the bookmarks bar of my browser with lots of frequently-used and aggressively abbreviated bookmarks.

Recent tools for managing links (Better browser history, Google desktop, Quicksilver, del.icio.us, etc) make fastidious categorisation of bookmarks a thing of the past, or at least somewhere past the point of diminishing returns. But there are still some benefits to be had from spending some time making your most-used bookmarks easily accessible. Here is the current set from my home browser, purged of work sites that aren't really of interest here.

 * <a href="javascript:void(location.href=location.href.substring(0,location.href.substring(0,location.href.length-1).lastIndexOf('/')+1))">&#8593;</a> - Goes "up" a level. Surprisingly handy for navigating around 404 errors. Not really needed on Firefox, where the [Link Toolbar](http://cdn.mozdev.org/linkToolbar/) extension is teh win.
 * Doc - A folder with bunch of links to locally-stored HTML documentation. Especially handy for Javadoc.
 * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon</a> - Great source of album cover art.
 * arwiki - A personal wiki site. I'm finding this very handy for storing notes and such. Must blog about this some time...
 * <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">bb</a> - BoingBoing obviously. Required daily reading.
 * <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/myblogs">blogs</a> - Bloglines of course.
 * <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/">CcLeche</a> - Elliote Rusty Harold's excellent XML news site. I used to do a lot more XML stuff and this was daily reading. It's mainly here now because he doesn't have an RSS feed.
 * <a href="http://del.icio.us/girtbynet">del.icio.us</a> - [Nuff said](/archives/2004/10/07/delicious-links/).
 * <a href="http://my.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyeBay&ssPageName=h:h:mebay:AU">eBay</a> - I have a great eBay story to tell ... soon.
 * <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">engadget</a> - Great way to kill an idle few moments.
 * <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> - Don't really need this here because of the various Gmail notifiers I have installed, but I can't bear to take it off.
 * <a href="javascript:u=location.href;t=document.title;s='';x=document;y=window;if(x.selection){s=x.selection.createRange().text;}%20else%20if%20(y.getSelection){s=y.getSelection();}else%20if(x.getSelection){s=x.getSelection();}%20d='http://gmail.google.com/gmail?view=cm&cmid=0&fs=1&tearoff=1';%20if(t){su=t;}else{su=u;}d=d+'&su='+escape(su);if(s){d=d+'&body='+escape(u)+escape('\n\n')+escape(s);}void(window.open(d,'gmail','toolbar=no,width=700,height=700'));">gmailit</a> - A *damn* handy bookmarklet. Gmails a link to the current page. Stolen from [here](http://www.trenchant.org/plugins/).
 * girtby - a folder with links to this website, the admin pages, etc
 * <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/">groups</a> - Believe it or not, there are still some topics worth reading on usenet.
 * <a href="http://www.memepool.com/">meme</a> - Jumped the shark really, but still worth a read occasionally.
 * <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">smh</a> - My main news outlet these days, for better or worse.
 * <a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a> - As seen on TV.
 * <a href="http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/index.cfm">tv</a> - As seen on slashdot.
 * <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">Y!</a> - For when you don't have [dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/) handy
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a> - Can't think of a good way to shorten this ('pedia? W-pedia? wikip?)
