    Grats!

    I think it's traditional to completely remodel one's site on a blogoversary.

Happy anniversary, Girtby.net, you're one year old today!



<a id="more"></a><a id="more-131"></a>


#### Girt by Growth

Here are the numbers from the first year:

Posts: 122
Comments: 214 (non-spam)
Visitors: 56,832
Pages Viewed: 157,648 (excluding robots)
Total traffic: 2.59GB

This is far more than I had ever expected, in all areas. By far most of the traffic seems to have occurred after posting the [local wordpress mirror HOWTO](/offerings/wordpress-osx-local-mirror) back in February. This article kickstarted girtby's traffic, as you can see on this graph (September in progress):

<img src="/images/traffic-2005.png" height="407" width="533" alt="Graph of traffic for girtby.net for 2005 (in progress)" class="centered" />

Of course building traffic is not really the [purpose](/archives/2004/12/08/why-bother/) of girtby.net, but it is gratifying in a way that people other than myself seem to be amused by this humble blog.

You can't see it on a graph, but blogging on girtby.net been great fun, and it has definitely served the purpose it was originally intended to. Thanks to all humans who visited my online ego, hope you enjoyed your stay. Thanks especially to those who take the time to post comments and blog posts in reply. It's very gratifying.

#### Girt by Firsts

 * [First post](/archives/2004/09/18/first-post/)
 * First frantic reworking after posting due to terrible choice of words/phrases/subject
 * First draft abandoned after realising that I actually don't have anything interesting to say about some topic

This image is still popular with Italians ([1](http://triumphorum.forumup.it/post-39081-triumphorum.html#39081), [2](http://www.iobloggo.com/community/scheda_blog.php?bid=2781)), [Russians](http://www.livejournal.com/community/un_mouton/32363.html), [Slovenians](http://artistocracy.blogspot.com/2005/10/invitation-to-exclusive-private.html), [Swiss zombie fans](http://www.divusmodus.ch/forum/index.php?s=168de375b4320a40142e516c1b1c9679&showtopic=1774&st=15) and [Dutch kiddies](http://www.imonline.nl/muurensoon).

#### Greatest Hits

You might not have noticed, but I think the style has changed gradually, hopefully for the better. I started off blogging furiously and trailed off to a more sustainable rate as the months went by. The linkpimpin' posts became less frequent, and I am now (mostly) immune to web memes. The style now is less stream-of-consciousness, more considered, more betterer writtin's, and in general more rewarding to write.

Looking back, I'm quite proud of the short posts like [Catachresis of the Year](/archives/2004/12/20/catachresis-of-the-year/) and [YAGA](/archives/2005/01/06/yaga/). But I think it's the more lengthy, recent posts that are my best work. Go ahead, take a stroll down memory lane:

 * [No Patentisation without Implementation](/archives/2005/08/22/no-patentisation-without-implementation/)
 * [Scheduled Task Slippage and Breakage](/archives/2005/08/03/scheduled-task-slippage-and-breakage/)
 * [This is What You See. This is What You Get.](/archives/2005/06/13/this-is-what-you-see-this-is-what-you-get/)
 * [What Does This Button Do?](/archives/2005/03/31/what-does-this-button-do/)
