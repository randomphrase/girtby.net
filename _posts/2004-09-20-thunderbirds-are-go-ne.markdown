In the original Thunderbirds TV puppet show, there was the occasional use of a live human hand closeup. Usually pulling a lever or doing something too complex for puppetry. The new Thunderbirds movie is of course all live action (or a CGI approximation), but it was very nice to see a split-second shot of a puppet hand with clearly visible strings.

(Aside: I wonder if the geeks at imdb noticed that too? Damn, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167456/trivia">of course they did</a>).

Other noteworthy features of the new movie:

<ul>
	<li>Lots of great corny lines ("like a puppet on a string") and terrible acting (Bill Paxton at the peak of his abilities).</li>
	<li>Bad stuttering jokes from Anthony Edwards, no doubt cast as Brains because of his unforgettable performance in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds</a>.</li>
	<li>Must. Buy. Ford.</li>
	<li>Thunderbird 2 doesn't store it's rescue equipment in numbered cargo pods any more. No idea how they work out which exactly-suited-to-the-emergency piece of kit to take. Maybe they take the lot?  But that would leave  no opportunity for "whoops we brought the wrong cargo pod!" dramatic tension.</li>
	<li>Lady Penelope was hot, but just a little too young for the character I thought. Or maybe I'm a little too old. Naaah.</li>
</ul>

The 4-year-old is a big fan of the TV series, but was unimpressed with the movie. "It's not real, is it dad?" he kept asking me. To which I had to confess "no son, it's just a movie". However I have the sneaking suspicion that what he meant was "It's not the same as the TV series, is it dad?". Which, no, it isn't.
