<img src="/images/outback-steakhouse-menu.jpg" alt="Outback Steakhouse Menu" width="215" height="318" class="lede"/>A long time ago in a country far, far away I visited the <a href="http://www.outback.com/index.asp">Outback Steakhouse</a> and was inspired by their hilariously tacky meal names: Melbourne Steak, Gold Coast Ribs, Kookaburra Wings, Ayers Rock Giblets, that sort of thing.

At the time I made up a new menu for them, which I will now regurgitate (err) for you.

Dead Dingo's Donger Desserts
Wombat Snot Cheez-Wiz
Goanna Toenail Clippings with Galah Dipping Sauce
Quokka Quango Quince Paste
Western Suburbs Cultural Wasteland Breadsticks
Bloody Annoying Blowflys Crawling Up Your Nostrils
Scare The Foreigners Snake Tongue Soup
Stereotypical Crocodile Wrestling Mashed Potatoes
Gratuitous Use Of The Word Crikey Bean Sprouts
Aged Member Of Monarchy Still Head of State For Some Reason
Prime Cut of Minister, Conservative Style
Unsold Fluffy Toy Mascots From The Best Bloody Olympics Ever

And, for dessert:

Vegemite
