    Really love your article. It is the closest I could find on the search engines to what I'm looking for.

    do you know where I can get hold of the microsoft user interface standard? Whould like to do some comparisons myself!

    Help will be much appreciated!

Let's pick on PowerPoint's User Interface problems [again](/archives/2005/03/31/what-does-this-button-do/)! Won't that be fun?

Here we are, about to edit a comment made to a PowerPoint 2003 document. The cursor is flashing, so lets start typing. What could go wrong?

<img src="/images/ppt - edit comment not.png" height="208" width="307" alt="Edit PowerPoint comment ... not" class="centered" />

*BeeBeeBeeBeeBeeBeeBeeep*

Hmm. Why isn't it accepting our keystrokes?

Turns out that the comment is not editable. This is what an *editable* comment looks like:

<img src="/images/ppt - really edit comment.png" height="204" width="322" alt="Really edit comment" class="centered" />

See? The two screenshots are *completely* different. One box is, like, bigger than the other!

Silly us. We forgot that Special Microsoft User Interface standard rule that non-editable boxes are *smaller* than editable ones. We'll know next time. I mean, in retrospect it's so obvious.

MS Office fans who may be suspecting foul Photoshoppery can follow along at home using these simple instructions:

 1. Open a PowerPoint document
 1. Insert a comment
 1. Click outside the comment box to reduce it to it's "unopened" state
 1. *Single*-click on the minimised comment
 1. Double-click on a word to select it
 1. Single-click next to the word to de-select it
 1. Single-click *again* to put a blinking cursor in there

Boom! A non-editable comment with a flashing cursor.

This sequence of instructions sound a bit far fetched? Consider that the only way to get an editable comment is to close it, then *double-click*. This is not an obvious course of action when you've already opened the comment with a single-click. Instead you click around madly trying to work out why it won't put a cursor down to edit the comment, and before you know it, you have! (Except it doesn't accept keystrokes)

Something tells me I need to create a whole new category on this blog for Office 2003 UI gripes. Naah, that would be too obvious.
