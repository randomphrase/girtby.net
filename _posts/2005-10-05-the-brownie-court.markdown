So on the one hand, we have a desperate attempt to reassure everyone that, despite Katrina, at least the Feds are ready for the next disaster. Bush has [thought about all the scenarios](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002540337_bushflu05.html). Should the unthinkable happen, the troops are going to be called in, and kill all the Asian chickens they can find. Or he'll [declare martial law](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/05/bush.reax/). Or something.

So that's nice, they saw what was wrong last time and fixed it. Or the nearest Texan equivalent.

But obviously the shameless nepotism which was at least partially responsible for the FEMA bubble is not seen as being worthy of a similar reaction, when considering the next nominee for the Supreme Court justice. You might think they would be prudent, with the [opinion poll figures plummeting](http://tis.goringe.net/2005/10/05/bush-index-modelling/) to nominate someone who is conservative &mdash; a given &mdash; but not *directly* associated with the White House. Sadly, no.

We have a new nomination to the vacant Supreme Court position who is none other than Bush's personal lawyer. Her name is [Harriet Miers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Miers). And she's never been a judge before. Or even argued a case before the SCOTUS.

By my calculations this makes Arabian Horse judge Mike "Brownie" Brown **more** qualified than Miers. I hear he's available...
