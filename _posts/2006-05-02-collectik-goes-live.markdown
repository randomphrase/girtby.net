Got enough Web 2.0 in your life? No? What you need is a social podcast aggregator with folksonomic tagging!

In a word: [Collectik](http://collectik.net).

I'm still wrapping my head around it, but I'm looking forward to finding lots of new and interesting things to listen to.

Congratulations to Chris and the rest of the team.
