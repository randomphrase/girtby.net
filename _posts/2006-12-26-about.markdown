Hello, I'm Alastair Rankine.

From 2004&ndash;2009 I ran a blog here. But then I got bored of it.

I am still online though. You can find me on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/alastair), [twitter](http://twitter.com/randomphrase), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/randomphrase), [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arankine/), and probably lots of other social networking timesinks by the time you read this.

So, you want to know more about the enigmatic character behind all the bad jokes, incomprehensible rants, statements of the bloody obvious, and assorted other self-indulgent nonsense that is girtby.net? Well, look no further. Here is where I <del>recycle old posts</del> tell all, in easy-to-write question and answer format.

### What do you look like?

Behold my visage and tremble. That's me on the left.

### What is your Elevator Statement?

I am a thirtysomething recovering software engineer living in Sydney Australia.

### What does girtby mean?

Basically it’s a nerdy allusion to a line from the Australian national anthem: “Our home is girt by sea”. To most people with a working sense of humour this line is a creaky old relic that always prompts a bit of a snigger. To me, it also adds a bit of charm to an otherwise pretty uninspiring tune. “Girt” is just a great word, and I think it’s time we revive it in daily usage. Hence the blog name.

### I am a real person and not a spamozoid. How can I contact you?

Send me email at (my first name)@girtby.net

### Do you have a privacy statement?

Does this look like a Real Website? OK, to answer the question, no.

You should assume that I will share anything and everything with the authorities if they so ask. And although I will try to do the right thing, if you want to keep something private don't send it to me.

### What is your policy on comments?

 - Defamatory comments posted here will be removed
 - Spam (according to my own definition which I will not share) will be removed
 - Other types of comments probably won't be modified, except perhaps to clean HTML markup

### What is your policy on (cr|h)acking?

[We have a policy that we are not being hacked.](http://www.kottke.org/04/07/my-new-policy)
