    Oh, that sucks. We've got the number of a fantastic sash cord window repair team, if it helps.

    We just recently had someone open a window and steal a couple of cameras. I'm sure we'd have lost more if it hadn't been for the back-to-base monitoring and the police rocking up shortly after they came in.

Looks like some friend of humanity decided to take a crowbar to our front window. They managed to get the frame open a crack, but then the glass broke and fell inwards. I guess they must have thought this was all too hard so they left without taking anything. Which was nice.
