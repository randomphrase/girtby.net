    Comment expressing agreement.

    New paragraph.

    Closing remarks.

    (Parenthetical postscript.)

    (Or, to put it another way: I've seen this particular curse everywhere I work, and it drives me insane.  Unfortunately, repositories get set up at precisely the point in time when the people setting them up know the least about them.  Naming things is *hard*.  I guess that's why.)

  content: Scott, the top of the heirarchy is surely the name of the repository itself?
    (And the naming of such things is another topic entirely...)

Got a common document repository? Have it organised into a hierarchy? Here is my official list of words that you should never use for nodes in that hierarchy.

Data, General, Misc, `$COMPANYNAME`, Stuff, Docs, Team, `$X`-Drive

If you find yourself using any of these vague and overly-generic terms, you really should re-think your taxonomy.

(This post requested by Scott, who I'm sure would never be responsible for using any of these...)
