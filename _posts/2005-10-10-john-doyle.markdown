  content: Totally agree. The speech was moving, deeply critical, and very funny -
    all at once.

Please don't let John Doyle's [fantastic speech for the 2005 Andrew Olle Media Lecture](http://www.abc.net.au/sydney/stories/s1476723.htm) pass you by. Grab the MP3 for the full effect.

This little aside by no means does justice to the range and depth of the speech, but nonetheless had me in hysterics on the way to work this morning:

> Tim Flannery recalls seeing a burial service in the [New Guinea] highlands whereby the deceased was picked up and swung over the grave with the family and onlookers solemnly chanting the incantation &lsquo;In the name of the Father and of the Son and into the hole he goes&rsquo;.

5 out of 5 on the read-the-rest scale.
