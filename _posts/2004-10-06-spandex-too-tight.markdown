This rather uppity cyclist either has some pretty sophisticated machinery or has no idea what 2WD means. I report, <a href="http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/03/1096741894840.html">you decide</a>.

<blockquote><strong>Why do motorists find my 2WD a threat?</strong>

I'm proud to say I'm a cyclist. Yes, I own a 2WD.</blockquote>

Maybe he's talking about one of <a href="http://people.cornell.edu/pages/jv19/">these contraptions</a>. Notice how they don't make you look like a goose at all.
