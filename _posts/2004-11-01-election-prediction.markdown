Kerry.

Wishful thinking? Mostly.

Although I will quite happily admit to selection bias in the news media that I choose to sample, I have recently come across some Kerry endorsements from relatively unexpected sources. As well as being one itself, the excellent <a href="http://www.beingdaddy.com/archives/000756.html">Being Daddy site posted a catalogue</a> of some of the more notable, unexpected Kerry endorsements, some from otherwise quite conservative sources.

Also there's the <a href="http://mattrubinstein.com/index.php?p=37">eeire predictive powers</a> of American Football (woooo spooooooky! <a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/2004_10_31_fafblog_archive.html#109924210771337965">wiggly fingers wiggly fingers</a>).

There are also a lot more voters turning out for registration -  I'm assuming this is good for Kerry. Also there are more swing states, including my once-home Colorado and the <a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/2004_10_24_fafblog_archive.html#109903862922132339">Kingdom of the Mole Men</a>!

Of course none of this is terribly definitive. Hence I'm still mentally preparing for a second Bush term by asking: how much worse could it get? (Answer: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/08/opinion/main648301.shtml">a lot</a>)

And whichever candidate eventually wins, it seems to me almost certain that the result will not be clear-cut. In fact, a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A439-2004Oct26.html?sub=AR">tie is not out of the question</a>. If the stakes weren't so high, it would be good entertainment.
