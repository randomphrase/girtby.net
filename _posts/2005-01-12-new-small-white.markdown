Gratiuitous opinion on the new Apple announcements today:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. What, they really couldn't fit an LCD display in there? Nonetheless looks like a nice small white thing. The 4G iPod is just a little too big for running with, so I might get one. Consider yourself warned though: "Do not eat iPod shuffle" (see footnote 2 on Apple's page).</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>.  This is just amazing. My only gripe is lack of optical audio output for playing AC-3 DVDs. Otherwise, it looks like an amazing media player box. I spend a lot of time moving the powerbook into the living room to play videos or show photos, so this looks just the ticket. Must. Have. Mac Mini.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">MacOS Tiger</a>. Glad it's getting close to shipping. Some of this is exciting, some not. Spotlight is the big new feature, but we'll see how it turns out in practice.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife 05</a>. Nice updates to iPhoto, the only iLife app that iUse. Don't really care about the others, so US$79 is a little steep. But I'm a sucker so I'll probably upgrade anyway.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a>. Good package, good price. Won't use it.</li>
</ul>

Update: Another great Apple corporate disclaimer was for the <a href="http://www.wap.org/journal/applepromouse/applepromouse.html">Apple Pro Mouse</a>:

<blockquote>This material is provided for information purposes only; Apple assumes no liability related to its use. Apple does not recommend allowing an elephant to operate a Mac in any environment.</blockquote>

But of course everyone knows that elephants are afraid of mice anyway...
