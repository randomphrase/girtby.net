  content: Where are these logfiles? I found the Web/FTP Stats, which let me know
    that people had got to the site by googling "christian disarray" and "poems about
    anthony minichiello". Me fans are just weird.

  content: Right next to the "Web/FTP Stats" in cpanel is a link to "Raw Access Logs".
    And don't forget the "Raw Log Manager", which is the next link across.

One of the nice features of my hosting provider is that they supply detailed log analysis. From this, it seems that the most popular post so far on girtby was the <a href="/archives/2004/09/30/fluffy-bunny-act/">Fluffy Bunny Act</a>. It got the most hits of any single post, and also a smattering of google hits.

So I pour heart and soul into lengthy, considered articles like <a href="/archives/2004/10/04/the-value-of-voip/">The Value of VoIP</a>, and yet the most popular post is a three-liner throwaway wrapping a link.
