    <h3>About girtby.net</h3>
    <p>Hello, I&#8217;m Alastair Rankine.</p>

<p>From 2004&ndash;2009 I ran a blog here. But then I got bored of it.</p>

<p>I am still online though. You can find me on <a href="http://identi.ca/alastair">identi.ca</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/randomphrase">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/randomphrase">last.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arankine/">flickr</a>, and probably lots of other social networking timesinks by the time you read this.</p>

<p>So, you want to know more about the enigmatic character behind all the bad jokes, incomprehensible rants, statements of the bloody obvious, and assorted other self-indulgent nonsense that is girtby.net? Well, look no further. Here is where I <del>recycle old posts</del> tell all, in easy-to-write question and answer format.</p>

<h3>What do you look like?</h3>

<p>Behold my visage and tremble. That&#8217;s me on the left.</p>

<h3>What is your Elevator Statement?</h3>

<p>I am a thirtysomething recovering software engineer living in Sydney Australia.</p>

<h3>What does girtby mean?</h3>

<p>Basically it’s a nerdy allusion to a line from the Australian national anthem: “Our home is girt by sea”. To most people with a working sense of humour this line is a creaky old relic that always prompts a bit of a snigger. To me, it also adds a bit of charm to an otherwise pretty uninspiring tune. “Girt” is just a great word, and I think it’s time we revive it in daily usage. Hence the blog name.</p>

<h3>I am a real person and not a spamozoid. How can I contact you?</h3>

<p>Send me email at (my first name)@girtby.net</p>

<h3>Do you have a privacy statement?</h3>

<p>Does this look like a Real Website? OK, to answer the question, no.</p>

<p>You should assume that I will share anything and everything with the authorities if they so ask. And although I will try to do the right thing, if you want to keep something private don&#8217;t send it to me.</p>

<h3>What is your policy on comments?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Defamatory comments posted here will be removed</li>
<li>Spam (according to my own definition which I will not share) will be removed</li>
<li>Other types of comments probably won&#8217;t be modified, except perhaps to clean HTML markup</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is your policy on (cr|h)acking?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/07/my-new-policy">We have a policy that we are not being hacked.</a></p>
